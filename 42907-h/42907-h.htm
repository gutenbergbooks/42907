<p class="sbt2">BECKY GIVES A DESCRIPTION OF AN INTERVIEW
BETWEEN HERSELF AND RICHARD MANX.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">My</span> <span class="smcap">Dearest Love</span>&mdash;How, did you like
my little messenger, Fanny? Is she
not steady, and bright, and clever? When
she woke this morning I had an earnest conversation
with her, and as far as was necessary
I told her my plans and that I wanted her
faithful assistance. She cried for joy. The
few words she managed to get out convinced
me that, child as she is, I could not be better
served by a grown-up person. Besides, I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
a child to assist me; a grown-up person might
spoil my plans. In what way? Patience, my
dear, patience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Preedy noticed that I looked tired, and
I told her that I had been kept awake all
the night with toothache. She expressed great
sympathy with me. It is wonderful the position
I hold in the house; I am treated more
like a lady than a servant. That is because
I have lent my mistress forty pounds, and
have agreed to pay for little Fanny&rsquo;s board
and lodging. Mrs. Preedy threw out a hint
about taking me into partnership, if I
would invest my fancied legacy into the
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could keep on this house,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and take another on the other side of
the Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said it was worth thinking about, but
that, of course, I could do nothing until I
received the whole amount of the legacy
which would be in three weeks&rsquo; time. So
the matter rests; during these three weeks
Mrs. Preedy will be very gracious to me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
expect. She said this morning, when I told
her about my toothache,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better lay down, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually! &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did lie down, and I had a good rest, so
that my keeping up all night did not hurt me.
I feel now quite refreshed, although it is
night, and eleven o&rsquo;clock. Mrs. Preedy, as
usual, is out gossiping with Mrs. Beale, and I
am writing in the kitchen. When she comes
home I shall continue my letter in my bedroom.
I have much to tell you. Things
seem to move on rapidly. I have no doubt
that in a very short time something important
will come to light.</p>

<p>After sending Fanny to you this morning,
I went up to our bedridden lady-lodger, Mrs.
Bailey. From her I obtained some significant
news. She had passed a bad night; the
noise in the next house, as of some one moving
about in the room in which your father met
his death, had &ldquo;come again,&rdquo; she said, and
had continued for at least a couple of hours.
She declared that it did not sound like mice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and that she did not know really what to
think. What she <em>did</em> know was that she was
almost frightened out of her life. I suggested
that Fanny should sleep in her room for a
night or two, and I told her about the little
girl. &ldquo;It will be company for you,&rdquo; I said.
The old lady was delighted at the suggestion,
and with the consent of Mrs. Preedy, I made
up a bed for Fanny on the floor, close to the
wall, and she is sleeping there now. I
am satisfied she is asleep, because Richard
Manx is not in the house. I have confided
in Fanny, and she is so devoted to
my service that I am certain, while she is
in her bed, no sound can be made in
the room adjoining without her hearing it.
Her faculties have been sharpened by a life
of want, and her nature is a very grateful
one.</p>

<p>It was not without reflection that I have
taken advantage of the opportunity to change
Fanny&rsquo;s bedroom. It will afford me a better
excuse for going upstairs more frequently
than usual, and thus keeping a watch on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
movements of our young man lodger. It
will also give Fanny an opportunity of watching
him, for I intend employing her in this
way, and in watching another person, too.
Richard Manx has not seen my little detective
yet, nor shall he see her, if it can be prevented.
My instructions to Fanny are to
keep herself carefully out of his sight; it is
part of a plan, as yet half formed, that she
should be very familiar with his face, and he
not at all familiar with hers. Twice during
the day has she seen him, without being seen,
and this evening she gave me a description of
his personal appearance so faithful as to be
really startling. Slight peculiarities in him
which had escaped my notice have not
escaped Fanny&rsquo;s; she has found out even that
he wears a wig, and that he paints his face.
This poor little child is going to be invaluable
to me. If all goes well with us we must take
care of her. Indeed, I have promised as
much.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you what else I have done,
and what has occurred. In the note you sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
back by Fanny this morning, you express
anxiety concerning me with reference to
Richard Manx. Well, my dear, I intend to
take great care of myself, and in the afternoon
I went out shopping accompanied by
Fanny. I paid a visit, being a woman, to a
milliner and dressmaker, and bought some
clothes. For myself? No, for Fanny, and
with them a waterproof to cover her dress
completely, from top to toe. Then I made
my way to a wig shop in Bow Street, and
bought a wig. For myself? No&mdash;again for
Fanny. And, after that, where do you think
I went? To a gunsmith, of all places in the
world. There I bought a revolver&mdash;the
tiniest, dearest little pistol, which I can hold
in the palm of my hand without anyone but
myself being the wiser. I learnt how to put
in the cartridges. It is very easy. With that
in my pocket, I feel almost as safe as if you
were by my side. Do not be troubled about
this, and do not think I am in any danger. I
am perfectly safe, and no harm will befall me.
Of course, there is only one person to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
it might happen I would show my pretty little
pistol&mdash;to Richard Manx. And I am convinced
that the merest glimpse of it would be
enough for him. You can tell by looking
into a man&rsquo;s face and eyes whether he is brave
as well as bold, and I am satisfied that Richard
Manx is a coward.</p>

<p>I saw him this evening. I have not yet had
an opportunity to tell you that he endeavoured
to make himself very agreeable to me three
days ago, when he met me, as I was returning
to Great Porter Square from the post-office.
He promised to make me a present of some
acid drops, of which he seems to be very
fond. He did not keep his word until this
evening, when he presented me with a sweet
little packet, which I put into the fire when
I was alone. He spoke of his property and
his expectations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said he, as he offered me the
sweets, &ldquo;that this paper was filled with diamonds;
it would be&mdash;a&mdash;more agreeable.
But I am poor, miserably poor&mdash;as yet. It
will be one day that I shall be rich&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
shall I present myself to you, and offer to you
what I better wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you do so?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;You are a gentleman, although you have no
money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said, interrupting me, and
placing his hand on his heart, &ldquo;I am a gentleman.
I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I am so much beneath
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said, energetically; &ldquo;I have
said to you before, you are a lady. Think
you I do not know a lady when she presents
herself? It is not station&mdash;it is not birth&mdash;it
is not rank. It is manner. On my honour
I say it&mdash;you are a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave him a sharp look, doubtful for a
moment whether he was in earnest; but the
false ring in his false voice should of itself
have convinced me that he was as insincere
as it was possible for any human being
to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he said, with a wave of his hand
towards the Square, &ldquo;still excitement. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
still come to look and see. What do they
expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is because of that
wonderful account in the newspaper about
the poor gentleman who was murdered. Did
you read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I read it!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;I was the
first. It is what you say&mdash;wonderful. What
think you of the lady with the pretty name&mdash;I
forget it&mdash;remind me of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lydia,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Lydia. It is a pretty name&mdash;remarkable.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; thought I, following
his words and manner with close attention,
&ldquo;if you think the name so pretty and remarkable,
how comes it that you forget it so
soon?&rdquo; But I did not say this aloud.)
&ldquo;What think you of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is to be pitied,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it
was a dreadful story she told the reporter.
It is like a romance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A romance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is something that
is not true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>must</em> be true,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do you suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
any person&mdash;especially a lady, as Mrs. Holdfast
is&mdash;could possibly say what is not true,
in such a position as hers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not&mdash;a&mdash;possible,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You
are right. What say the people? As you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can say nothing else. What object
could she have to serve in speaking anything
but the truth? Her husband is dead;
that wicked young man&mdash;what was his
name?&rdquo; I asked, serving him in his own
coin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; he said, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wicked young man, Frederick, is
dead, and she is left alone, a rich widow.
Money is very nice. I should like to have as
much. I think it would almost console me
for the loss of a husband&mdash;especially a
husband much older than myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgive me, my dear, for speaking in this
way, but to say honestly to a man like
Richard Manx what is in one&rsquo;s mind would
not be wise.</p>

<p>He smiled at my words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Madame Lydia
thinks as you. But you would not have been
so&mdash;what do you call it? indiscreet?&mdash;yes,
that word will do&mdash;you would not have been
so indiscreet as to say to a gentleman of the
press as much as she said. It was too candid&mdash;there
was no&mdash;a&mdash;necessity. Why proclaim
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not proclaim it?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;It
may assist justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assist what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;What is that unfortunate
lady&rsquo;s first and most earnest desire?
To discover the murderer of her husband, and
to make him pay the penalty of his crime. It
would be mine. I would even go to see the
monster hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the proper word. Monster&mdash;yes, he
is, he must be. But you could never&mdash;no
never! You are too soft&mdash;that is, tender.
Who is the monster? If you it were who
was wronged, I am he who would find him.
But this Madame Lydia, she is to me nothing.
What say you? Can you suspect? In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Great Porter Square can anyone suspect?
Our amiable lady of No.&nbsp;118&mdash;Mrs. Preedy&mdash;even
she cannot say. Ah, but it is dark&mdash;mysterious.
Yet I have a thought&mdash;it is
here.&rdquo; He tapped his forehead. &ldquo;Shall I
speak it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! Why? It is not to me an interest.
But if you wish so much to hear! Ah! well&mdash;my
thought is this. The son, the wicked
young man, Frederick, he is, they say, dead.
But if he be not dead? What then? The
monster, he&mdash;in secret to kill the father he
betrayed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned my face from him, for I felt that
it had grown suddenly white. My heart beat
violently. Swiftly to my mind rushed the
thought of your deadly peril. There came to
me, in one clear, convincing flash, what,
under other circumstances, would have taken
me hours to work out. Think for yourself&mdash;consider
calmly the circumstantial force of all
that has passed&mdash;and you will see, as I see,
how easy it would be to construct a chain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
evidence against you from which it is scarcely
possible you could escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are agitated,&rdquo; said Richard Manx.
&ldquo;You turn from me. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant I recovered my self-possession.
I turned my face to him, and it seemed to me
as if I had forced colour into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thought is so horrible,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;That a son should kill his father in
cold blood! I cannot bear to contemplate
it. What wickedness there is in the
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said Richard Manx, with a smile,
as though we were conversing on a pleasant
subject. &ldquo;Then what shall a man do? Live
well&mdash;eat well&mdash;drink well&mdash;sleep well. There
is a reason. The world is wicked. I cannot
alter it. You cannot alter it. A lesson
comes. Enjoy. Must you go? Must
you leave me? I kiss your hand. No?
In my fancy, then. Till again, fair Becky,
adieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our conversation was at an end, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thankful. I have been particular in my
endeavour to show you the man, from his
words and manner of speech. Good-night,
my dearest. In my own mind I am satisfied
that this day has not been wasted. It leads
to days more important to you and to your
ever devoted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">IN WHICH BECKY NARRATES HOW FANNY BECAME
ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. LYDIA HOLDFAST.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">My</span> <span class="smcap">Dear Love</span>,&mdash;Again I beg of you,
in reply to your expressions of anxiety
in the letter Fanny brought to me this
morning, not to give yourself unnecessary
anxiety about me. You are alarmed at the
position in which I have placed myself; you
are alarmed because Richard Manx is in the
same house with me; you are alarmed
because I have bought a revolver. I assure
you there is no reason why you should be so
distressed. The position in which I have
placed myself is, I am more than ever convinced,
the only one which will enable me to
reach the heart of this mystery. Richard
Manx is but one person against many. I, and
Mrs. Preedy, and Fanny, and the neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the policeman, with whom I am on
friendly terms, are surely more than a match
for him. You are alarmed because I have in
my possession a toy pistol. Is not a woman,
in an emergency, to be trusted with a weapon?
In such circumstances as ours, why should
not a woman have as much courage as a
man? Why should not a woman undertake
a task such as I have undertaken, when her
heart is engaged in it, when the honour and
safety of the man she loves are engaged in it,
when the whole happiness of her life and his
is engaged in it? That would be like saying
that women are fit for nothing in the world
but to wait upon men&rsquo;s actions and to follow
them, whichever way they lead. It is not so.
In such a crisis as this a woman can do, and
do better, what it would be out of the power
of a man to accomplish. I would willingly
relinquish my task if I thought it could be
accomplished without my aid. But it cannot
be. You are powerless; there is no one but
myself capable and willing to carry it out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and indeed, indeed, I am in no danger! My
dear, you underrate our sex. Read this
letter carefully, and then confess that your
fears are groundless, and that I am doing
what is right and best to be done.</p>

<p>Fanny heard nothing last night. There
was no sound in the next house. For a
reason. Richard Manx was not in his room,
and did not make his appearance until this
afternoon. Then I remembered that last
week, on the same day, it was the same.
There is one night in the week, then, in
which he has business elsewhere. I shall take
advantage of that discovery.</p>

<p>When Fanny returned with your letter this
morning, I prepared for a masterstroke. Its
success depended much upon chance, much
upon Fanny&rsquo;s shrewdness. I cut her hair
short, and fitted the wig I bought yesterday
on her head. It is a wig of fair hair, with
long curls. She looks lovely in it. When
night fell, I dressed her in her new clothes,
which were not new, but second-hand; and,
covered with the waterproof, there she was,
ready for her task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>My desire was that she should manage to
become acquainted with Mrs. Lydia Holdfast,
and so ingratiate herself with that person as
to be able to bring me reports of her movements
and proceedings. Having impressed
this upon her, I asked her whether she would
undertake the task. Her answer was that she
would go through fire and water to serve me;
that she knew exactly what I wanted, and was
going to do it. I was so satisfied with her
readiness that it was with a feeling of great
confidence I sent her on her mission. I
waited for my opportunity, and no one saw
her leave the house. Whether what I called
my masterstroke will really turn out to be
one will be proved in a very short time.
Something has already been achieved. Fanny
has become acquainted with Mrs. Lydia
Holdfast.</p>

<p>She returned an hour ago, and is now abed
in old Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room. Exactly at ten
o&rsquo;clock I went into the Square, and found
Fanny waiting for me. I whipped off her wig,
and brought her home. The nights are dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and there is little fear of detection; and even
in that case I have an amusing story ready,
which will easily account for what will look
like a harmless freak.</p>

<p>When she left Great Porter Square, Fanny
went at once to the house in which your
father lived, and which his widow still inhabits.
She waited outside for a long time
until at length a lady came out whom, from
my description of her, Fanny recognised to
be Mrs. Lydia Holdfast. A carriage was at
the door, and as Mrs. Holdfast stepped towards
it, Fanny pulled her dress. Mrs. Holdfast
snatched her dress away impatiently,
without speaking, and walked to her carriage,
Fanny following her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want? What do you
want?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, speak!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Holdfast.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m in a hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A coachman stood at the carriage door to
wait upon his mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you alone, please,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Holdfast. &ldquo;Take
this beggar-girl away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coachman endeavoured to obey the
order, but little Fanny was too quick for him.
She slipped between his arms, and again
stood by the side of Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you Mrs. Holdfast?&rdquo; she asked,
looking up into the lady&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Grace Holdfast,&rdquo; said Fanny, as bold
as brass. I think it would be difficult to find
her equal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast, as she heard this name,
Grace, which Fanny spoke loudly, gave a
scream, and seizing Fanny by the arm,
hurried back with her into the house. There
were servants standing about, but Mrs. Holdfast
took no notice of them; she put her hand
on Fanny&rsquo;s lips, and dragged her into an
empty room. Closing the door, and locking
it, she bent down to Fanny and shook her
roughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny did not speak or scream, but twisted
herself as soon as she could from Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s
grip, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! You have made my wig all
crooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heaven only knows where this child got
her wits from, but if she had been drilled for
a month she could not have acted the spirit of
her part with greater cleverness. The words
I did not teach her; I simply told her what I
wanted her to do, and left the rest to
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You have made my
wig all crooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she ran to the looking-glass and set
it straight again. There must have been something
in her manner which made Mrs. Holdfast
laugh, but as Fanny described it, her laugh
was broken off in the middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here directly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>Fanny obeyed. Mrs. Holdfast knelt upon
the ground, and, holding Fanny&rsquo;s face between
her hands, looked long and hard at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; she said; and then
she coloured up, for she saw that Fanny was
returning the earnest gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, my lady,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I
beg your pardon for calling you Grace; my
sister said you wouldn&rsquo;t like it, but you were
running away, and I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your sister?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Holdfast.</p>

<p>And now imagine Fanny, instead of at once
answering the question, fainting dead away.
A real swoon? Not a bit of it. A sham,
to gain time to study the ground of action.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast, at first, did not appear to
know what to do. She allowed Fanny to lie
on the ground, and although the child&rsquo;s eyes
were nearly quite closed, she declares that
not a movement nor an expression of Mrs.
Holdfast escaped her. I am entirely inclined
to believe every word spoken by Fanny as she
related the adventure. She says that Mrs.
Holdfast looked at her for a moment, then
turned away for a moment, then looked at her
again, as though wishing that she was dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Upon which Fanny gave a sigh, and murmured
something about being faint and
hungry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast rang a bell, and going to the
door, unlocked it, and spoke to a servant,
from whom she received a decanter of wine.
She locked the door again, and returning to
Fanny, raised the child&rsquo;s head, and put
the decanter to her lips. Fanny allowed herself
gradually to recover, and presently
opened her eyes, and struggled to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Holdfast, &ldquo;who is
your sister, and what has brought you
here?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">IN WHICH BECKY NARRATES HOW FANNY BECAME
ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. LYDIA HOLDFAST.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">By</span> this time Fanny had invented a cunning
little story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, my lady,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;my
sister is an actress, and I&rsquo;ve come here to ask
you to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know me; you&rsquo;ve never
spoken to me before,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never spoken to you,&rdquo; said Fanny,
&ldquo;but I remember you well. You used to go
to the theatre in the country, where Nelly
was engaged. That&rsquo;s the reason she sent me
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Nelly your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady. She was in the front row,
and I used to come on in the crowd. I got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
shilling a night, and Nelly had a pound a week.
We lived near you in Oxford, and often saw
you pass. Nelly was always talking of you,
and saying how beautiful you were, and what
a lady, and how lucky to have such swell
friends. She used to wish she was like you,
and when you went away she wondered
where you had gone to. Well, things got bad,
and Nelly and I came to London a month ago;
and now she has left me, and I don&rsquo;t know
what I am to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your sister take you with
her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could tell you; I can&rsquo;t, except that
she said two&rsquo;s company and three&rsquo;s none.
She said yesterday morning, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off, Dot; I
can&rsquo;t stand this any longer. No engagement
and no money. You must look after yourself,
Dot. I tell you what to do if you&rsquo;re
hard up. You go to this address&rsquo;&mdash;(and
she gave me the address of your house)&mdash;&lsquo;and
ask for Mrs. Holdfast. Don&rsquo;t say
Grace Holdfast&mdash;she mightn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;and
say I knew her in Oxford, and ask her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to help you. She&rsquo;ll do it. She&rsquo;s got a
kind heart, and knows what it is to be unfortunate.&rsquo;
Well, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;except that in
the afternoon a gentleman came, and asked
for Nelly. She goes down to him, and I hear
what they say. It ain&rsquo;t much. &lsquo;Are you
ready?&rsquo; the gentleman asks. &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; says
Nelly, in a kind of saucy way, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ready
enough.&rsquo; Then Nelly asked him for some
money, and he gave her a sovereign. She
runs up to me, whips on her hat, kneels down,
kisses me, puts the sovereign in my hand,
and says, &lsquo;Good-bye, Dot, I can&rsquo;t help leaving
you; what&rsquo;s the use of stopping here to starve?
Get away from this house as soon as you can,
for there&rsquo;s rent owing that I can&rsquo;t pay. Mrs.
Holdfast will give you a lift if you want
one.&rsquo; She kisses me quick, over and over
again, and runs down stairs, and out of the
house. Well, I&rsquo;m crying and the landlady
comes in and asks, sharp, where Nelly has
gone, and when I tell her, she flies into a
passion, and says there&rsquo;s three weeks&rsquo; rent
owing, besides other money. My hand is shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
tight, with the sovereign in it, and the landlady
must have seen it through my fingers,
for she tries to force them open, but she can&rsquo;t
till she digs her knuckles into the back of my
hand, when, of course, the sovereign rolls out.
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says the landlady, &lsquo;your sister&rsquo;s left this
on account. All right; I hope she&rsquo;ll pay
the rest when she comes back.&rsquo; She pockets
the sovereign, and this morning she turns me
out of the house, and tells me she has let the
room. So I am obliged to go, and I didn&rsquo;t
know what else to do except to come to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not in a position to describe the
exact effect this story, as related by Fanny,
produced upon Mrs. Holdfast. For my part, I
was amazed at the child&rsquo;s ingenuity. I doubt
whether she could have invented anything
that would be likely better to serve our purpose.
I am of opinion that Mrs. Holdfast
was both amused and frightened, and I think
she has some plan in her head with reference
to Fanny. At all events, she gave Fanny five
shillings, and bade her come again to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the evening; and before Fanny left her, she
made the child promise not to mention to a
soul in the world anything about ever having
seen her anywhere else but in London.
Fanny promised, and left the house. To come
straight home to me? No. The cunning
little creature waited outside Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s
house until the lady came out. She watched
her get into her carriage, and when it started
she ran ahead of the horses until she was out
of breath. Then she called a cab, and paying
the man out of her five shillings, told
him to follow the carriage. It stopped at
the Criterion Theatre, and Fanny, jumping
from the cab, saw Mrs. Holdfast enter the
theatre.</p>

<p>That is all I have to tell you to-night. You
may be assured that Mrs. Holdfast does not feel
any poignant grief at the loss of her husband.
Otherwise she would keep from theatres for a
little while. The state of widowhood is
evidently one which gives her satisfaction. I
wonder what the Reporter of the newspaper
who wrote the &ldquo;Romance of Real Life,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
partly from her own lips, would say, if he saw
Mrs. Holdfast laughing in the theatre so
shortly after the discovery of the murder of
her husband. Because the piece they are
playing at the Criterion is taken from the
French, and is intended to make you laugh.
All the actors and actresses who play in it
are comedians, and do their best to create
fun. The Reporter would put on his &ldquo;Considering
Cap,&rdquo; as the children&rsquo;s books say. If
she had gone to see a tragedy, where she
could cry her eyes out, she might have
offered some excuse. But a laughable play,
the morality of which is not very nice! That
is a different pair of shoes. Undoubtedly it
is a risk for Mrs. Holdfast to run; but unless
I am much mistaken in her, she loves to run
risks. She could not live without excitement.
Your father&rsquo;s widow, my dear, was not cut out
for a nun.</p>

<p>I feel like a person with a chess board
before her, in the middle of a game which,
to lose, would ruin her. I shall not lose it.
Every hour the position of the pieces is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
more clear to me, and I am discussing
in my mind the advisability of two or three
bold moves. But I will wait a little; something
of importance will very soon be revealed
to me. Good night, my dear. Sleep well.
Every moment that passes brings our happiness
nearer and nearer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">MR. PELHAM MAKES HIS APPEARANCE ONCE MORE.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">My</span> <span class="smcap">Dear Love</span>,&mdash;My note written last night
was short, because I had scarcely anything
to say, and I postponed what I had to
tell until to-night. Mrs. Holdfast did not
detain Fanny long yesterday. She asked
but one question, which, if the little girl
had not been prepared to answer, would
have removed Fanny from the game, and
increased the difficulties of our task. In
the story Fanny invented for the mystification
of Mrs. Holdfast I saw one great
danger. Mrs. Holdfast is not playing alone;
there is a master mind behind her. Who
that master mind is it was necessary for me
to discover, and I have made the discovery.
I shall not be surprised if, in the letter I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shall write to you to-morrow night I am
able to tell you something of the very greatest
moment.</p>

<p>Fanny&rsquo;s danger was this: She had told a
clever story; had invented a sister, and had
furnished a tolerably fair excuse for forcing
herself upon a lady of Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s position.
But she had spoken of herself and her sister
living in lodgings in London. If there is one
thing Mrs. Holdfast desires at present to
avoid it is the slightest chance of anything
coming before the public which would tend
to prove that she and Grace who destroyed
Sydney Campbell are one and the same
person. Perhaps the only person who, in
an indirect way, is aware of this fact (that is,
to Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s knowledge) is Fanny.
Here was a risk; and between Fanny&rsquo;s first
and second visit to Mrs. Holdfast, the suggestion
had in some way arisen that the little
girl might have been instructed in her part by
an unseen enemy. It was necessary, therefore,
to test the truth of Fanny&rsquo;s story, and
there was only one point which could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seized upon. In what street in London, in
what house, did Fanny and her sister live
before the sister ran away? This occurred
to my sharp mind before it had been
suggested to Mrs. Holdfast, and I determined
to manufacture evidence. I enlisted Mrs.
Preedy on my side. I bought her a new
gown, a cloak, and a hat, and I made her a
present of them. Then, having entirely won
her heart&mdash;she told me that she looked upon
me as a daughter&mdash;I cautiously imparted to
her what I wanted her to do for me. It
appeared that nothing was easier. For a few
shillings a friend of Mrs. Preedy, living half
a mile from Great Porter Square, undertook,
in case a lady called to ask there, to give
certain answers to certain questions about
two lodgers, one called Nelly and the other
Dot. The lesson was a simple one, and was
easily learned. Armed with the address,
Fanny went to Mrs. Holdfast, according to
appointment. I may inform you that I am
placing fuller reliance than ever upon little
Fanny, and that I have related to her a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
deal of Grace&rsquo;s life in Oxford, which, in case
of need, she can turn to useful account. As
I anticipated, Mrs. Holdfast asked Fanny in
what house she and her sister lived in
London. Without hesitation, Fanny gave
the address of Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s friend, and Mrs.
Holdfast dismissed her, desiring her to call
again on the following day&mdash;this morning.
I ascertained to-day that Mrs. Holdfast called
at the address, and received the answers
prepared for her.</p>

<p>I must tell you what Mrs. Preedy said to
me during the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you are not what you pretend
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave her a spirited answer, knowing by
this time how to manage her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a clever woman,&rdquo; I replied, looking
at her admiringly; &ldquo;you have guessed
my secret; not one in a thousand would have
done it. I am <em>not</em> a servant-of-all-work, and
I came here to be out of the way, let me say,
of my young man. Well now, there&rsquo;s no
harm in that, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of harm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But what
is it all about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you just now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
may be certain of one thing. If things go on
as they&rsquo;ve been going on lately, you will be
none the worse off for it. If I don&rsquo;t go into
partnership with you, I shall make you a
very handsome present, and I shan&rsquo;t ask you
for any wages. I have broken a lot of things
since I&rsquo;ve been here, but I&rsquo;ve bought new
ones in their place. Mrs. Preedy, you leave
everything to me, and I will show you that
Becky can be grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Preedy, &ldquo;so
long as there&rsquo;s no harm done, I don&rsquo;t mind.
You&rsquo;re a good sort, and I dare say have seen
a lot of trouble. So have I. Women are
born to be imposed upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does our young man lodger pay his rent
regularly?&rdquo; I asked, pretending to know
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Preedy, sadly, &ldquo;since
he has lived here I haven&rsquo;t seen the colour of
his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, smiling, &ldquo;suppose I pay it
for him. Not for his sake&mdash;for yours. I&rsquo;m
not sweet on him, though he pretends to be
on me. It&rsquo;s a shame that you should be taken
in by a foreign gentleman like him&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
afford it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found out how many weeks&rsquo; rent he owed,
and I paid it. I don&rsquo;t think anything is
wanting to complete the conquest of my
mistress&rsquo;s heart. You see I am spending some
of the money you gave me; I couldn&rsquo;t get
along without it.</p>

<p>To-day Mrs. Holdfast received Fanny very
graciously, called her a nice little thing, said
she was growing quite fond of her, and was
almost inclined to take her into the house to
live with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I wish you would!&rdquo; cried
Fanny.</p>

<p>However, it appears that at present Mrs.
Holdfast, even if she is in earnest, cannot take
Fanny into her house. If it <em>were</em> done Fanny
would find a way to communicate with me,
and tell me all that is going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast expressed great curiosity
about Fanny&rsquo;s sister, and asked the child
whether Nelly did not give her an address
to write to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said Fanny, prepared for any
emergency; &ldquo;Nelly&rsquo;s gone to Paris. She
said I might write to her at the post-office
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What does Mrs. Holdfast do but write a
letter to Fanny&rsquo;s sister, and address it to the
Poste Restante, Paris. She did not give the
letter to Fanny to post. What is in the letter?
Nothing important, perhaps, but written in
the endeavour to more completely verify the
truth of Fanny&rsquo;s story. Or perhaps Mrs.
Holdfast really knew some actresses in the
country, and is anxious to ascertain if Nelly
is one of her old acquaintances.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you something more important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a shrewd little thing,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Holdfast to Fanny; &ldquo;I have a good mind,
although I can&rsquo;t let you sleep in the house, to
take you into my service.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, do, ma&rsquo;am, do!&rdquo; cried Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try you. But mind&mdash;you must
keep my secrets. Do you know any person in
London besides me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a blessed soul!&rdquo; replied Fanny.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll keep your secrets&mdash;you try me. O,
I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a kinder lady in the
world than you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an artful one,&rdquo; said Fanny to me, as
she gave me the particulars of this conversation,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m an artfuller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast is so extraordinarily vain that
even this deserted child&rsquo;s praise was agreeable
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be true to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdfast, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll make a lady of you. Are you fond of
babies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which Fanny replied that she doted on
them. Mrs. Holdfast rang a bell, and desired
the maid who answered it to take Fanny into
the nursery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up to you presently,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Holdfast.</p>

<p>Fanny went into the nursery, where she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
what she describes as the loveliest baby in the
world, all dressed in laces and silks, &ldquo;more
like a beautiful wax doll,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;than
anything else.&rdquo; It was Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s baby,
the maid told Fanny, and her mistress doted
on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good many babies and a good
many mothers,&rdquo; said the maid, &ldquo;but I never
saw a mother as fond of a baby as Mrs. Holdfast
is of hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny&rsquo;s account agrees with the maid&rsquo;s
words. When Mrs. Holdfast came into the
nursery, and took her baby, and sat in a
rocking chair, singing to the child, Fanny said
it was very hard to believe that a woman like
that could do anything wrong. If Fanny
were not truthful and faithful to me,
and would rather have her tongue cut
out than deceive me, I should receive her
version of this wonderful mother&rsquo;s love with
a great deal of suspicion. But there can be
no doubt of its truth. I remember that the
Reporter of the  <cite>Evening Moon</cite> spoke of
this, and that it won his admiration, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
could not fail to win the admiration of any
person who did not know how wicked is the
heart that beats in Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s bosom.
Can you reconcile it with your knowledge of
her? I cannot. It does not raise the character
of the woman in my eyes; it debases it.</p>

<p>In the nursery Mrs. Holdfast gave Fanny a
letter, with instructions to deliver it to the
gentleman in person, and to wait for an
answer.</p>

<p>My dear, this letter was addressed &ldquo;Mr.
Pelham, 147, Buckingham Palace Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here at once is established the fact of the
continuance of the intimacy between Mr.
Pelham and Mrs. Holdfast. Is it possible that
your father, after you left the country, discovered
that his wife was deceiving him, and
flew from the shame of her presence? It
must be so. What, then, took place between
husband and wife, and to whose advantage
would it be that he should be made to disappear?
I shudder to contemplate the
answer. I can find but one; it is horrible to
think of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny received the letter without remark,
and went to the address in Buckingham
Palace Road. Mr. Pelham was in, and Fanny
was desired to walk up-stairs. There, in a
handsomely-furnished room, she saw Mr. Pelham,
lounging on a sofa, smoking and drinking.
&ldquo;A regular swell,&rdquo; said Fanny. He
tore the letter open, and tossed it away
passionately, without reading it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t taken anything out of it?&rdquo;
he cried to Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as
Mrs. Holdfast gave it to me. I was to wait
for an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny says he looked as savage as if he had
expected to find the envelope full of money,
and didn&rsquo;t find a penny. He drew the letter
to him and read it; then rose, and took some
paper from a desk, scribbled an answer, which
he put carelessly into an envelope and threw
over to Fanny, saying, &ldquo;Give her that!&rdquo;
Fanny states that he is not an agreeable-looking
gentleman, and that there is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
about him that reminds her of &mdash;&mdash; but here
Fanny stopped, and would not finish what
she intended to say. She roused my curiosity,
but she would not satisfy it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea
in my head. If it&rsquo;s a right one I shall
astonish you. If it ain&rsquo;t, it would be foolish
to speak about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could get nothing more than this out of
her, and I let the subject drop, but there is
evidently something very weighty on her
mind.</p>

<p>She hurried into the street with Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s
answer to Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s note, and
getting into a quiet nook, where she was free
from observation, asked a girl to read it to
her. Mr. Pelham had scarcely wetted the
gum, and the envelope was easily unfastened.
Fanny endeavoured to commit the letter to
memory, but she failed; the girl who read it to
her could not quite make out the words. The
letter contained a demand for money, and Mr.
Pelham said in it that before the week was
out he must have a cheque for five hundred
pounds. One remark Fanny perfectly remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
&ldquo;If you are going to turn
niggardly and stingy,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Pelham, &ldquo;I
shall have to keep the purse myself. Don&rsquo;t
forget that the money is as much mine as
yours, more mine than yours indeed, and that
I could ruin you with one word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny says that when Mrs. Holdfast read
the letter (which she delivered properly
fastened) and came to those words&mdash;of course
Fanny could only guess that&mdash;Mrs. Holdfast
said aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yourself, too, Pelham. It would go
harder with you than with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment&mdash;only for a single moment,
as I gather from Fanny&mdash;Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s face
grew haggard, but she became gay again
instantly, and began to sing and talk
lightly. Can such a nature as hers really
feel?</p>

<p>Again, for the second time this week,
Richard Manx has not come to his room in
Great Porter Square. I make sure of this by
putting the chain on the street door after mid-night.
I attach importance to the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
circumstance now, and do not allow anything
to escape me. Do not for a moment let your
courage and your hopefulness fail you. We
have not yet obtained a tangible link to start
from, but it appears to me as if events were
coming closer; something will come to light
presently which will assist in the discovery of
your father&rsquo;s murderer. You are never absent
from my thoughts; you are for ever in my
heart. I am yours till death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FANNY DISCOVERS WHO RICHARD MANX IS.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">My</span> <span class="smcap">Darling</span>&mdash;What has occurred to-day
must be related with calmness, although
my mind is in a whirl of excitement. The
presentiment I felt last night that we were on
the threshold of an important discovery has
come true. A discovery <em>has</em> been made
which neither you nor I could ever have
dreamt of, and we have to thank Fanny for
it. How wonderfully all the circumstances of
life seem to be woven into one another! Little
did I think, when I first met the poor, hungry
little girl, and was kind to her, that she would
repay me as she has repaid me, and that we
should owe to her, perhaps, the happiness of
our lives. I may be mistaken; I may be
speaking more out of my heart than my head,
more out of my hopes than my reason. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
surely what Fanny has discovered will lead to
a discovery of greater moment. It is, as yet,
the most important link in the chain. We
must consider what is best to be done. At
noon, Fanny said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a holiday; I&rsquo;ve got something
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke abruptly, and with great earnestness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t intend to run away from me,
Fanny,&rdquo; I said, and immediately repented
my words, for Fanny seized my hands, and
kissed them, with tears running down her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run away from you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Never&mdash;never&mdash;never!
How could you think it of
me. I would die for you&mdash;indeed, indeed I
would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I quieted her, trying to excuse myself by
saying that it was only because she was keeping
something secret from me that the words
escaped me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m doing it for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To-night
I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, read how Fanny passed the day. I
will relate it as nearly as possible out of her
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I went into Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s room,
yesterday,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in Buckingham Palace
Road, I didn&rsquo;t suspect anything at first. I
didn&rsquo;t like his looks, but that was nothing.
There are lots of people I don&rsquo;t like the looks
of. I remained there while he threw away
the letter, and while he drank and smoked.
He was drinking wine, and he emptied three
glasses one after another. It wasn&rsquo;t till he got
up and went to his desk that I noticed something&mdash;a
twitch of his left shoulder upwards,
just as a man does when he shrugs his
shoulders. But Mr. Pelham did not shrug his
two shoulders, he shrugged one&mdash;the left one.
I only knew one other man who did with his
left shoulder what Mr. Pelham did, and I
thought it funny. While he was writing his
letter he threw away his cigar, and took a
cigarette, and the way he put it into his mouth
and rolled it between his lips was just the
same as the other man who twitched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
shoulder as Mr. Pelham did. Well, as I
walked back to Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s house, I
seemed to see the two men&mdash;Mr. Pelham and
the other, shrugging their left shoulders, and
rolling their cigarettes in their mouths, and
what they did was as like as two peas, though
they were two different men, though one was
poor and the other rich. I couldn&rsquo;t help
calling myself a little fool when the idea came
to me that they were not different men at all,
and I said to myself, &lsquo;What do they mean
by it? No good, that&rsquo;s certain.&rsquo; So I made
up my mind to do something, and I did it
to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, there was Richard Manx. I watched
him out of the house. He came down from
his garret a little after twelve; I stood in the
dark passage, and watched him coming downstairs;
he seemed to be out of temper, and he
gave the wall a great blow with his hand. I
think he would have liked to hear it cry
out, so that he might be sure he had hurt it.
I thought I shouldn&rsquo;t like him to strike <em>me</em>
in that way&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose he would if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any one was looking. He would have hit me
as he hit the wall, if he had known what I
was up to&mdash;that is, if nobody was near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went out of the house, closing the street
door, O, so quietly behind him. Have you
noticed how quietly he does everything? He
walks like a cat&mdash;well, so can other people.
I waited a minute after he closed the street
door, and then I slipped out after him. I
looked all ways, and I saw him just turning
out of the Square into Great King Street. I
soon turned the corner too, and there I was
walking behind him on the other side of the
way, with my eyes glued to him. Well, as
good as glued. I can walk a long way
behind a person, and never lose sight of
him, my eyes are so sharp, and I didn&rsquo;t lose
sight of Mr. Richard Manx, as he calls himself.
He walked Lambeth way, and I noticed that
he was looking about in the funniest manner,
as though he was afraid he was being watched.
The farther he got from Great Porter Square
the more he looked about him; but no one
took any notice of him&mdash;only me. Well, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
went down a street where half the houses
were shops and half not, and at the corner
of the street was a coffee-shop. There were
two doors facing him, one going into the shop
where people are served, and the other going
into a passage, very narrow and very dark.
A little way up this passage was a door,
which pushed open. Mr. Manx, after looking
about him more than ever, went into the
narrow dark passage, and pushed open the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I had to do now was to wait until he
came out, and to dodge about so that I
shouldn&rsquo;t be seen or caught watching for
something I didn&rsquo;t know what. It was a hard
job, as hard a job as ever I was at, and it
was all that I could do to keep people from
watching me. I waited an hour, and another
hour, and another hour, and Mr. Manx never
came out of the coffee shop. I was regularly
puzzled, and tired, and bothered. But I
didn&rsquo;t know what a little fool I was till after
waiting for at least four hours I found out
that the coffee shop had two more doors on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
side facing the other street; doors just like the
others, one going into the shop, and the other
into a narrow dark passage. When I found
that out I thought that Mr. Manx must have
gone in at one door in one street and come
out at the other door in the other street, and
I was regularly vexed with myself. But that
didn&rsquo;t help me, and I walked away from
Lambeth towards Buckingham Palace Road.
I wanted to see with my own eyes if Mr.
Pelham was at home. He was; I saw him
stand for a minute at the window of his room
on the front floor. Then I set to watching
him. I wanted to find out where he was
going to, and what he was up to. I suppose
it was seven o&rsquo;clock, and dark, before
he came out. He walked till he met a cab,
and as he got in I heard him give the direction
of Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s house. That was enough
for me; I followed him there, my feet ready
to drop off, I was that tired. But I wasn&rsquo;t
going to give up the job. No one came
out of Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s house till nine o&rsquo;clock
struck; then the street door was opened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and Mr. Pelham walked into the street. He
stood still a little, and I thought to myself
he is thinking whether he shall take a cab.
He didn&rsquo;t take one till he was half-a-mile
from Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s house. I ran all the
way after it. It was a good job for me that
the cab was a four-wheeler, and that it went
along slow, for running so hard set my heart
beating to that extent that I thought it
would jump out of my body. I scarcely
knew where we were going, the night was
that dark, but I knew it was not in the
direction of Buckingham Palace Road. Mr.
Pelham rode about a mile, then called out to
the cabby, and jumped on to the pavement.
He paid the man, and the cab drove away,
and then Mr. Pelham walked slowly towards
Lambeth, looking about him, although the
night was so dark, in exactly the same way
as Mr. Manx had done when I followed him
from Great Porter Square. I had been on my
feet all the day, and had walked miles and
miles, and I hadn&rsquo;t had a bit of bread in
my mouth since breakfast&mdash;but when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
certain that Mr. Pelham was walking to
Lambeth I didn&rsquo;t feel hungry or tired. I said
to myself, &lsquo;Fanny, your idea was right; but
what does it all mean?&rsquo; Well, I couldn&rsquo;t
settle that; all I had to settle was that the
two men who shrugged their left shoulders,
and who rolled their cigarettes in their mouths
in the way I had noticed, were not two men
at all, but the same man, living in one place
as a gentleman and an Englishman, and in
another as a poor foreigner without a shilling.
So I was not at all surprised to see Mr.
Pelham, dressed like a swell, stop at the coffee
shop at which Mr. Manx had stopped, and
push through the dark passage by the door I
had not noticed when I was waiting in the
street this morning for Mr. Manx, and I wasn&rsquo;t
at all surprised that Mr. Pelham didn&rsquo;t come
out again. The man who came was the man I
wanted, and I followed him home here to
Great Porter Square, and he is in the house
now.&rdquo; And here Fanny concluded the account
of her day&rsquo;s adventures by asking, &ldquo;Who
came in five minutes before I did?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard Manx,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one,&rdquo; said Fanny, triumphantly;
&ldquo;Richard Manx is Mr. Pelham. There&rsquo;s no
difference between them, except that one
wears a wig, and paints his face, and talks like
a foreigner, and that the other lives in a fine
house, and drinks wine, and dresses like a
gentleman. That was my idea last night.
That was what I had to do when I asked you
this morning to let me go for the day. There&rsquo;s
something in it; I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;that&rsquo;s
for you to find out. Are you pleased with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pressed the faithful child in my arms, and
she gave a sigh and fainted. She was so
eager to tell me of her discovery, and I was so
anxious to hear it, that we both forgot that
for fifteen hours not a morsel of food had
passed her lips.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">BECKY AND FANNY ON THE WATCH.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A cup</span> of hot tea and some bread and butter
soon made little Fanny lively again,
and when she was quite recovered I questioned
her upon many little points, so as to make
sure that she was not mistaken. She convinced
me. Richard Manx and Mr. Pelham
are one and the same man, and Richard
Manx&rsquo;s motive for taking lodgings in this
house was that he might obtain, in a secret
and unsuspected manner, access to the
room in which your father was murdered.
For what purpose? To destroy every evidence
of the crime before the house comes into the
possession of a new tenant, who might by
chance discover what, up to the present
moment, has escaped the eyes of the police?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
No&mdash;scarcely that, in a direct way. He is not
seeking to destroy or discover anything which
he <em>knows</em> to be in existence; he is searching
for a document which he <em>suspects</em> your father
concealed before he met his death. This is
but a reasonable explanation of Richard
Manx&rsquo;s presence here. Arguing in the dark,
as we are, and without positive knowledge,
we must have a tangible foundation on which
to build our theories. I am speaking and
arguing like a man, am I not, my dear? I
wonder at myself as I read over some of the
things I have written; but they are a proof
that I have thrown aside all that is weak in
my nature, and that I have courage and
decision to meet any emergency.</p>

<p>The document which Richard Manx suspects
your father to have hidden, and for which he
is searching, must, if it really exist, be of the
utmost importance. Shall I tell you what
Richard Manx believes this document to be?
A second Will, which would make a beggar
of the woman who betrayed him, and consequently
of Mr. Pelham, who, with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
father&rsquo;s widow, is enjoying your father&rsquo;s
money&mdash;<em>your</em> money, my dear! I am not
mercenary, but next to the clearing of your
name and the punishment of your father&rsquo;s
murderer, I want you to enjoy what is your
own. Selfish mortal that I am, I want you
to be happy and rich, and I want to share
your happiness and riches.</p>

<p>If Richard Manx obtains possession of this
document, it will be a serious blow to us.
Something must be done, and done promptly&mdash;and
at the same time we must not put
Richard Manx on his guard.</p>

<p>Now, pay particular attention to the
following little piece of reasoning. Look at
the date of the  <cite>Evening Moon</cite> in which the
public were first made acquainted with the
name of the murdered man. And by the side
of that date place the significant fact that Mr.
Pelham, disguised as Richard Manx, took
lodgings here three weeks before that discovery
was made. What follows? That Mr.
Pelham knew, three weeks before the police
became acquainted with the fact, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
your father who had been murdered. Why,
then, should he not have known it on the
very night of the murder itself, and why did
he keep the knowledge to himself? What
was his reason for concealment? A world of
dreadful conjecture opens itself to me, and I
am almost afraid to put my thoughts on paper.
They are not centred alone on Mr. Pelham;
Mrs. Holdfast intrudes herself in a way that
makes me shudder. My God! Is it possible
that there can be such wickedness in the
world?</p>

<p>In the account Mrs. Holdfast gave the
Reporter of the  <cite>Evening Moon</cite> (I have the
paper now before me) from which he wrote
his &ldquo;Romance in Real Life,&rdquo; she says that in
her distress at the mysterious absence of her
husband, she went to a friend for advice.
This friend had interested himself in her case,
and had written to America in her behalf, to
ascertain particulars of her husband&rsquo;s movements.
Her friend it was who, according to
her statement, first suggested that her husband
might have been robbed and murdered. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sent her to a lawyer, who, during the interview,
made a private memorandum which she
read. The lawyer said, &ldquo;We will find your
husband for you, dead or alive;&rdquo; and then he
made the memorandum, as a guide for himself:
&ldquo;Look up the murders. How about the
murder in Great Porter Square?&rdquo; From that
she proceeds to describe how she went to a
number of shops, and bought a number of
newspapers containing accounts of the discovery
of the murder and of the accusation
brought against Antony Cowlrick. Her
suspicions were aroused. She gave the
lawyer a portrait of her husband, and in a
very little time it was ascertained and made
public that it was Mr. Holdfast who had been
murdered. Read by itself, the Reporter&rsquo;s
description is enthralling; those who read
for amusement would not stop to inquire as
to whether this was likely or that reasonable;
they would accept the statement without
question, and give their sincere pity to a lady
who had been so foully wronged. But, read
by the light of what has come to our knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the traces of collusion, deception, clever
acting&mdash;of guilt perhaps&mdash;are as clear as
sunlight. Observe that Mrs. Holdfast does
not give the name of her friend&mdash;who must
have been a very close friend indeed to take
such an interest in her. I will give you his
name&mdash;it is Pelham. Nor does she give the
name of the lawyer to whom Mr. Pelham sent
her. If you sought him and became acquainted
with his antecedents, you would
find that he was in Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s pay, and
that, up to a certain point, he acted in
accordance with instructions. I think I
have established the fact that Mr. Pelham
knew your father was dead long before it was
made public. Mrs. Holdfast must also have
known. Why did they wait so long before
they took steps towards the discovery? To
avert any chance of suspicion being directed
towards themselves? It is likely enough, and
that is also the reason, when you, as Antony
Cowlrick, were brought up at the police-court
on suspicion of being implicated in the
murder, why Mr. Pelham kept carefully out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of sight, and therefore had no opportunity of
recognising you. In this excess of caution he
over-reached himself.</p>

<p>At length, however, the time arrived when
it was imperative the name of the murdered
man should be made known, and Mr. Pelham
and Mrs. Holdfast acted in concert. Your
father&rsquo;s Will, of course, could not be proved
in your father&rsquo;s lifetime, so it was necessary
that the fact of his death should be established.
It was done, and clear sailing was
before them, with the exception of one
threatening gale which promises to wreck
them&mdash;the document for which Richard
Manx is searching. He has not found it yet,
or he would not have struck the wall so
viciously as he did this morning when Fanny
was watching him. Fate is against him, and
is on our side.</p>

<p>Another little point, of which a lawyer
would make a mountain. Did it not occur to
you as very strange that Mrs. Holdfast so
easily obtained from small newspaper shops
a quantity of newspapers relating to a murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at least three months old? The shops do not
keep a stock of old newspapers on hand:
I know that this is so, from personal inquiry.</p>

<p>Just now there comes to my mind the
report in the papers that, during the nine
days your father lived in the fatal house next
door, he had but one visitor&mdash;a lady, who
came so closely veiled that no person in the
house caught a glimpse of her face? Do you
think it possible that this lady was Mrs.
Holdfast?</p>

<p>Good night, my dearest. By the morning
some plan may occur to me which may help
us to the end. Fanny went to bed an hour
ago. Mrs. Preedy is asleep, and all is quiet
in the house. What would I give if I could
see into the mind of our young man lodger,
Richard Manx!</p>

<p class="ast">*****</p>

<p>I re-open my letter; I have something to
add to it.</p>

<p>No sooner did I lay my head on my
pillow than I fell asleep. I think I must
have slept over an hour when I was awoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by the sound of some one opening my bedroom
door. I raised myself in bed, and cried
in a loud tone, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t make a noise. I&rsquo;ve come
to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Fanny who spoke, and she was
standing at my bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you frightened, Fanny?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Shall I light a candle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;it might wake Mrs.
Preedy. I&rsquo;m not frightened. I&rsquo;ve been on
the look-out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I passed my hand over Fanny, and discovered
that she was fully dressed; but so
that she should not be heard she had taken
off her boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the look-out, Fanny!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why you haven&rsquo;t been in bed! What is the
meaning of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in bed,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;but I
didn&rsquo;t undress, and I didn&rsquo;t go to sleep. I&rsquo;ve
been listening. <em>He&rsquo;s</em> in the next house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Richard Manx!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I jumped up, and began to dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
myself. Heaven only knows why, for I
had no intention of going out of my bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Richard Manx,&rdquo; replied Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, like some one taking up the floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A loud noise then, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;everything&rsquo;s being done soft&mdash;like a
cat moving; but there&rsquo;s a crack sometimes,
and a wrench, just the noise that would be
made if boards were being taken up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words set me all in a fever. Richard
Manx was getting desperate, and did not
mean to give up his search without examining
everything in the room. What if he <em>should</em>
discover the document he is looking for? It
would be he, then, who would hold the
winning cards. The thought was torture. It
seemed to me as if I were within reach of
your happiness, your safety, of the vindication
of your honour, and as if they were slipping
from me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it is Richard Manx who is
in the next house?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As sure as guns,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you tell? You can&rsquo;t see through
the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wish I could&mdash;then I should find
out something more. When the noise first
came I didn&rsquo;t move for a long while; I
waited till Mr. Manx was deep in his little
game; then I got up so quietly that Mrs.
Bailey didn&rsquo;t stir, and I went out of the room,
and upstairs to the garret. The door was
shut, and I pushed it softly, and it gave way.
I slid downstairs like lightning, for if Mr.
Manx had been in the room he would have
come to the door at once; then, if he didn&rsquo;t
see anyone, he might think it was the wind
that had blown the door open. But he didn&rsquo;t
come because he wasn&rsquo;t in the room, and the
door remained just as I left it. I crept up
again, and peeped into the room; it was
empty, and there <em>was</em> a wind blowing&mdash;right
over my head. I looked up, and saw a trap-door
in the ceiling, open, and just under it
two chairs, one on top of the other. That is
how Mr. Manx reaches the roof; and he gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down into the next house through another
trap-door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Fanny?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the courageous little creature,
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I was going not to find
that out, do you? I should be a nice one if I
hadn&rsquo;t climbed up on the chairs, and lifted
myself up on to the roof. I can do that a
deal better than Mr. Manx, there&rsquo;s so little of
me. I crept along on all-fours, and reached
the other trap-door leading to the next house.
It was open. I didn&rsquo;t go down because it
was dark, and I was frightened of falling. It
wasn&rsquo;t that I cared about hurting myself, but
it would have brought Mr. Manx up to me,
and then all the fat would have been in the
fire. So I thought I would come back and tell
you. Would you like to come up, and see for
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made up my mind to go. Yes, I would
convince myself of the fact that it was
Richard Manx who haunted the murder-stricken
house for his own villainous purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>I was soon completely dressed, and, giving
Fanny some instructions, in case of danger, I
accompanied her upstairs. I held my tiny
revolver in my hand, and showed it to Fanny,
who expressed great admiration. The child
can be conquered by only one kind of fear,
that which comes from hunger. She has
suffered enough from that frightful torturer,
but will never again, I hope.</p>

<p>I went first into Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room; the
old lady was in a sound sleep. I listened
with my ear to the wall. Richard Manx was
busy; caution was expressed in his every
movement. Once or twice it almost seemed
as if I heard his voice in impatient anger. I
do not think it was fancy on my part; my
senses were exquisitely alert to the slightest
sign of this disguised enemy. While I was
in Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s room, Fanny remained in the
passage. I found out afterwards that she had
armed herself with a small, sharp-pointed
knife, which I am convinced she would have
used without hesitation in my defence. I
with my pistol, and Fanny with her knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
were more than a match for Richard Manx if
we came into collision. There is no bravery
in the villain; at the first show of danger he
would have fled, and Fanny, fleeter of foot
than he, would have been after him. I
hardly know whether it would be well for us
or not that he should fall into the hands of
the police, disguised as he is, and made to
give an account of his movements. I shall do
nothing for the next few hours to precipitate
events. They appear to be shaping themselves
to our advantage, for up to this
moment Richard Manx&rsquo;s search has proved
fruitless.</p>

<p>I went upstairs, with Fanny close to me, to
the garret. Everything there was as Fanny
had described. The room was vacant; two
chairs were strapped one on top of the other,
affording a firm footing by which a person
could climb on to the roof; the trap-door was
open. I did not hesitate to search the room.
In my detective capacity, proceedings I should
ordinarily have blushed to take I now deem
fair, but I found nothing in the place to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
me or to endanger the liberty of Richard
Manx. In a corner of the garret was a
common trunk, locked; I tried to open it,
but could not. I should have liked to find
a portrait of Mrs. Holdfast&mdash;a womanly wish,
which would never have occurred to you. I
was about to mount the chairs to the roof
when Fanny pulled my dress. Her quick ears,
quicker even than mine, had caught a sound.
We retreated noiselessly, closed the garret
door and sat at the foot of the stairs, listening
for Richard Manx&rsquo;s return. I wished to
ascertain by the evidence of my own senses
that he had not met with success in his search.
If he had found any document he would
have stopped up to read it before he retired
to rest. Rest! Can such a conscience as
this man must possess allow him ever to
rest?</p>

<p>Presently we heard him pull the trap-door
in the roof over him; we heard him descend
from the chairs, and place them in their
proper positions; we saw the light of his
candle through a chink in the garret door;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he moved about stealthily for a few moments;
and then he extinguished his light.</p>

<p>This was sufficient for me; we were and
are still on equal ground with respect to any
document your father may have concealed
before his death. For some hours all is
safe; in the day time Richard Manx dare
not enter the empty house. I have nothing
more at present to say. Good-night, dear love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">NO. 119 GREAT PORTER SQUARE IS LET TO A
NEW TENANT.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> the closed shutters of No.&nbsp;119 Great
Porter Square was attached a board, on
which were painted the words, &ldquo;This House to
Let on reasonable terms, or the Lease to be
sold. Apply to Mr. Stapleton, House Agent,
Great Andrew Street, Bloomsbury.&rdquo; The
board had grown disconsolate-looking and
disreputable, as though it was a partner in
the disgrace which had fallen upon the
tenement.</p>

<p>At the time the notice &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; was
attached to the shutters, the agent had no
hope whatever of letting the house. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t a chance of anybody taking it,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for at least three months.&rdquo; The three
months passed, and no probable tenant had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
made his appearance. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for
it but patience,&rdquo; he then said. &ldquo;Would
<em>you</em> live in the house?&rdquo; asked his wife, when
he was dilating upon the folly of people
allowing such a chance to escape them. &ldquo;Not
for untold gold!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Well then!&rdquo;
she exclaimed; winding up the argument
thus, as is the way with women.</p>

<p>He was much astonished, therefore, upon
returning to his office from his mid-day chop,
to find a gentleman waiting to see him, who,
closing the door of the little private room in
which he transacted special business, asked him
if No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter Square was still to let.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Stapleton; &ldquo;the board&rsquo;s
up; you can see it as you pass the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not passed through Great Porter
Square for a long time,&rdquo; said the gentleman,
&ldquo;and I was not aware that a board was up.
I was directed to come to you by a friend,
who told me you were the agent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to take the house?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Stapleton, looking with some suspicion
upon his prospective client.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have no objection,&rdquo; said the
gentleman, &ldquo;If I can have it on my own
terms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On any terms,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Stapleton,
a little too eagerly, and adding, in
correction of his over-haste, &ldquo;that is, for a
certain time&mdash;after which, of course, we
expect a fair rent. The prejudice against the
place <em>must</em> wear away one time or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the murder remains,&rdquo; observed the
gentleman, sadly; &ldquo;time will not wear that
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Stapleton, coughing;
&ldquo;nothing can wear that away. But I refer to
the sentiment, the feeling, the prejudice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You interrupted me just now,&rdquo; said the
gentleman, coming back to the practical. &ldquo;I
was about to say that I should have no
objection to take the house if I can have it
on my own terms and conditions. By
&lsquo;terms&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t mean money. I have no doubt
we shall agree upon the question of rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will put the house in repair for you,&rdquo;
said Mr. Stapleton; &ldquo;you can choose your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
own paper, and we will give it three good
coatings of paint outside. In fact, anything
you can suggest we shall be most happy to
consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to suggest,&rdquo; said the
gentleman, &ldquo;and I do not propose to put you
to the expense of a shilling for repairs. I
will take the house just as it is, if my conditions
are complied with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Stapleton looked gravely at his visitor,
and said, as he rubbed his chin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we could let the house for
the purposes of exhibition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the gentleman, &ldquo;I
should hope not. It would be making a
trade of murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr.
Stapleton, &ldquo;only you express them so much
more forcibly.&rdquo; At the same time, he began
to regard the gentleman as a very queer
customer indeed, and to wonder why he was
so long in coming to the point. Had he been
aware of the gentleman&rsquo;s inward agitation and
anxiety, and of what depended upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
result of this application, his wonder would
have been lessened, and he might have raised
the rent instead of lowering it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask what are your conditions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first and most important,&rdquo; replied
the gentleman, &ldquo;is secresy. I wish no one
to know that I have taken the house; I wish
no one to know that it is let. The board will
remain up; the house will remain as it is.
All that I shall require of you is the key of
the street-door. These conditions complied
with, I will pay you six months&rsquo; rent in
advance, and I will make myself responsible
for another six months. It is more than
probable&mdash;nay, it is almost certain&mdash;that
before three months are over I shall hand
you back the key, with the rent for the
additional six months. As a matter of
bargain, it is not a bad one for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; said Mr. Stapleton; &ldquo;what I
have to consider, on the other hand, is
whether it is a good thing for the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can do better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think I could; yours is the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
application I have had since the murder was
committed. You shudder, sir! It is enough
to make one. If I had not been an agent for
the estate, nothing would have induced me to
undertake the letting of such a house. What
am I to say in case another person, seeing
the board still up, applies to me for the
particulars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say that, although the board remains,
you have decided not to let the house for
two or three months. No one can compel
you to let it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr.
Stapleton. &ldquo;You will excuse my remarking
that there is something very mysterious in all
this, and that you appear singularly anxious
to take the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your remark is a natural one. There <em>is</em>
something mysterious in it, and I <em>am</em> most
anxious to become your tenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are candid enough in that respect, I
must say. Will you favour me with your
name and references?&mdash;you have references,
of course; they are indispensable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have references, with which you will be
satisfied. But I cannot give them to you, nor
can I disclose my name, until you say the
house is mine, on my conditions&mdash;to which I
must add another: that my name is not
entered on your books for your clerks to
comment upon and prattle about. If you
agree, and my references are satisfactory, the
matter can be concluded at once. If they
are not satisfactory, I cannot expect you to
accept me as a tenant. It will be a grief to
me, but I shall be compelled to submit, and
must seek another mode of carrying out my
designs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much was Mr. Stapleton&rsquo;s curiosity
excited that he consented to the proposed
arrangement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the references,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you to them,&rdquo; responded the
gentleman. &ldquo;I am most earnestly desirous
that the affair be concluded immediately.
Charge me what you please for your loss of
time in accompanying me, and believe that if
it be in my power to show my gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to you by-and-bye, I shall not miss the
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unusual as was this mode of conducting
his business, Mr. Stapleton consented, and
accompanied the gentleman to a house in the
most fashionable part of London, where he
obtained a recommendation in every way
satisfactory, and then to a common locality,
where a private detective, known to him by
name, vouched for the respectability of his
proposed tenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a police affair, then?&rdquo; he asked of
the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied
the detective. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve got to do with
it is to take your rent, and keep your mouth
shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wink&rsquo;s as good as a nod,&rdquo; said Mr.
Stapleton, and departed with his tenant to his
office, where the preliminaries were completed,
and the rent paid to him. He whistled
softly when he heard the name of the tenant,
which was given to him in confidence, but he
took the detective&rsquo;s advice, and kept his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shut&mdash;except to his wife, upon his return
home; but even to her he would impart
nothing more than that he had that day transacted
the strangest piece of business in his
experience.</p>

<p>Long before this strange piece of business
was concluded, Becky had received the following
reply to her letter:</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Darling</span>,&mdash;Your news is most important,
and little Fanny has earned my
undying gratitude. As for yourself, I am at
a loss what to say. The evidences of indomitable
spirit you have displayed have filled me
with wonder. It is given to me to know, as
no other man has ever known, of what a noble
woman&rsquo;s love is capable. You would inspire
a dying man with hope and courage; but remember,
you are a woman, and can only do,
under certain circumstances, what it is in a
woman&rsquo;s power to do. You have the heart of
the bravest man, but you have not his
strength. I know the villain Pelham, otherwise
Richard Manx, to be a coward, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hard to say to what extremes a desperate man,
brought to bay, may be driven. False courage
may come to him in such a crisis&mdash;to last
most likely but for a few minutes, or seconds
even, but long enough to do a deed which
may bring life-long sorrow to a loving heart&mdash;to
my loving heart, which beats for you,
as yours beats for me. Such a risk must not
be run. You could cope, I believe, better
than I could with such a creature as my
murdered father&rsquo;s widow, upon whose soul
lies the guilt of the death of two noble
gentlemen, but you are not the equal of
villains like Pelham, who would strike a
woman, and tremble in the presence of a
man. I feel faint to think of the peril you
were in when you and your brave little
friend entered Richard Manx&rsquo;s room in the
dead of night. You do not realise it; I
do, and I must take some step to avert
danger from the girl I love, and to bring
the murderer of my father to justice. The
time for watching is over; the time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
action has arrived. It is now for me to take
up the thread of evidence which you have
woven, and to strengthen it into a chain from
which the guilty cannot escape. Time is too
precious to waste; not another day, not
another hour, must be lost. I agree with you
that Pelham has reason to suspect that my
dear father left behind him, and concealed, a
document which may re-establish me in my
place among men, and supply damning evidence
against those who brought him to his
death. It is, I see well, the only direct evidence
upon which we can rely&mdash;for though
Pelham, by coming to your house under a
disguise, and by his subsequent actions, has
laid himself open to the gravest suspicion and
to certain disgrace, I doubt whether what
could be brought against him would be sufficiently
strong to clear up the awful mystery
of my father&rsquo;s murder. And that is my first
duty&mdash;to leave no stone unturned, to work
with all my strength and cunning, with all
my heart and soul and body, to satisfy the
claims of justice. My father&rsquo;s blood calls out
to me to devote myself utterly, to risk every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
danger, to die if need be, in the pursuit and
accomplishment of this sacred duty. To
bring disgrace upon Pelham is not sufficient&mdash;has
he not already reached that end in his
life and character? Something more than
suspicious motive is needed, and I will not
rest till he is hunted down, and his guilt
brought home to him. Again and again I
implore you to leave him now entirely to me.
Go up to his room no more, or you may mar
the steps I have already taken, and am about
to take. I have told you that, when I was
living in my dear father&rsquo;s house, I had in my
employ a detective who tracked the shameless
woman to an appointment with Pelham,
and through whose instrumentality I hoped to
open my father&rsquo;s eyes to the true character of
the wife who was disgracing him. You know
how she worked upon my father&rsquo;s deep love
for her, and frustrated my just design. The
use of the detective was, and is, revolting to
me, but there was (and to a certain extent is)
no other way of obtaining evidence. This
detective, with men under him, is again in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
employ. It was he who brought my Statement
to you when I lately returned from
Liverpool. Mr. Pelham, in his own proper
person, and in the disguise he has assumed, is
now under strict surveillance; and the partner
of his guilt, my father&rsquo;s widow, is also being
watched. Not a movement outside their
houses will escape notice; nor shall they
escape, in their own persons, if they make the
attempt. I think something of the kind is
meditated, for Mrs. Holdfast&mdash;it maddens me
to think that I must call her by the name
which I hope you will one day bear&mdash;is converting
into money all my father&rsquo;s property,
and she is not doing this without
a motive. Let her beware! The sword is
hanging over her head, and may fall at any
moment. I can imagine no greater misery
for this woman than to be thrust upon
the world in a state of poverty. For even
if she could be proved guilty of nothing
but love&rsquo;s treachery as regards my father,
I shall have no pity for her. She has tasted
the pleasures of wealth, and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
poison all her after-life to be deprived of
it. I write bitterly, and I do not attempt
to disguise my feelings. The face of this
woman&mdash;fair, alas! but that is one of the
mockeries of nature&mdash;as it rises before me,
seems almost to blight the sweet beauty
which lies in innocence, truth and purity.
Forgive me for my bitterness; I have suffered
much; had it not been for you I should have
lost all faith in goodness. How much I owe
you!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not surprise me to learn, through
Fanny&rsquo;s reading of the letter which Mr.
Pelham gave her to deliver to Mrs. Holdfast,
that Pelham and she are at variance upon
monetary matters. Such natures as theirs
are of necessity grasping and avaricious, and
although they are bound to each other by
the closest and most dangerous ties, there
cannot possibly be harmony between them;
experience has made each suspicious of the
other, and has shown them, through the
mirror of their own souls, how little of truth
and honesty they can expect from each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Had my father died a natural death, I should
have been content to leave them to their own
punishment&mdash;bitterer than any enemy could
have made it for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By to-night&rsquo;s train a messenger leaves for
Paris; to-morrow morning he will receive at
the Poste Restante the letter Mrs. Holdfast
wrote to Fanny&rsquo;s imaginary sister, Nelly.
There may be nothing in it, but I have caught
the inspiration of your own bold spirit; not
a chance must be lost sight of. The messenger
will open and read the letter in Paris, and, if
necessary, he will reply to it and post his
reply there. This, in any event, will avert
suspicion from your brave little Fanny&mdash;God
bless her!&mdash;in case she and Mrs. Holdfast
should meet again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will readily understand that the expenses
of all these proceedings are more than
I could meet, in my present position, unless I
had at my back a rich and generous friend.
I have that friend in Adolph, who knows
everything; I have concealed nothing from
him; his indignation against our enemies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his sympathy for ourselves, are unbounded.
He has supplied me with ample means, not
caring, he says, whether the money is ever
repaid. After all, my dear, there is more light
than shadow in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">THE NEW TENANT TAKES POSSESSION OF NO.
119 GREAT PORTER SQUARE.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">An</span> hour before midnight of the day on
which No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter Square
was let to a new tenant, a man dressed in
plain clothes walked leisurely round the
Square in a quiet and secretly-watchful
manner. Rain was falling, and there were
but few persons about, but, although the man
spoke to none, he appeared to take an interest
in all, scrutinising them closely with keen,
observant eyes. Between him and the policemen
he met in his circuitous wanderings a
kind of freemasonry evidently existed. Once
or twice he asked, under his breath, without
stopping:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>And received in answer the same words,
spoken rapidly and in a low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No other words were exchanged.</p>

<p>As the church bells chimed eleven, Richard
Manx entered Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s house, No.&nbsp;118,
letting himself in with his latch-key. He
passed the man who was walking round the
Square, but took no notice of him. As he
stood at the street door, searching in his
pocket for his latch-key, the man passed the
house, and did not even raise his eyes to
Richard Manx&rsquo;s face. The presumption was
that they were utterly indifferent to each
other; but presumptive evidence is as often
wrong as right, and between the actions
of these two men, strangers to each other,
existed a strong link which boded ill to
one of them. At a quarter past eleven Mrs.
Preedy, somewhat later than her wont,
bustled out of her house for her nightly
gossip with Mrs. Beale. By this time the rain
was coming down faster, and when Mrs.
Preedy disappeared, Great Porter Square may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
be said to have been deserted, with the exception
of the one man who had been walking
there for an hour, and the policeman
sauntering at the corner. The man now
paused before Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s house, and
knocked softly at the door. Becky&rsquo;s sharp
ears caught the sound, soft as it was, and she
ascended from the basement, and inquired
who was there. The answer was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky opened the door, and peered out,
but it was too dark for her to recognise the
man&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Miss,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been here before. I brought a packet and a
letter to you from Mr. Frederick. He sent me
here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I to know that?&rdquo; asked Becky.</p>

<p>The man smiled in approval, and handed
Becky an envelope addressed to herself. She
retreated into the passage, and while the man
remained upon the doorstep, she opened the
envelope and stooped down. There was a
candle on the floor which she had brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from the kitchen, and by its light she read
the few words written on the note paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The man who gives you this is the detective
I mentioned in my letter this morning.
Trust him and attend to his instructions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Becky returned to the detective and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you now. What do you want me
to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any chance of Richard Manx
hearing us?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>

<p>Becky, placing her fingers to her lips went
to the basement stairs and called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child appeared immediately, and Becky
whispered in her ear for a few moments.
Fanny nodded, and crept softly upstairs in
the direction of the garret occupied by
Richard Manx.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are safe,&rdquo; said Becky to the detective.
&ldquo;Richard Manx cannot hear what
we say. Fanny is keeping watch on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny&rsquo;s a clever little thing,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
detective admiringly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a daughter
with her wits. Now, Miss, keep in your mind
what I am going to tell you&mdash;not that there&rsquo;s
any need for me to say that. You are
working for Mr. Frederick, as I am, and
others with me. A watch is going to be
set outside this house&mdash;and if it&rsquo;s done as
well as the watch you&rsquo;ve kept inside the
house, we shan&rsquo;t have any reason to grumble.
In what room does the old bedridden lady,
Mrs. Bailey sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first floor back,&rdquo; replied Becky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the first floor front open? Can you get
into the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have the key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the room, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the detective,
stepping back and looking up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a balcony before the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the window open easily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I have never tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you oblige me by stepping upstairs
and trying now? And it will save trouble if
you leave the window open. Be as quiet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
you can, so as not to alarm Richard Manx.
I&rsquo;ll keep outside the street door while you&rsquo;re
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky went softly into the kitchen for the
key of the first floor front, and then went upstairs
and opened the door. She might have
been a shadow, she glided about so noiselessly.
The window was not easy to open, but she
succeeded in raising the sash almost without
a sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; she said, as she stood before
the detective once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have another daughter,&rdquo; said
he, in a tone of approval, &ldquo;with wits as sharp
as yours. I believe Mr. Frederick was right
when he told me there was not your equal.
Now, something&rsquo;s going to be done that will
take about a quarter-of-an-hour to do, and
we want to be sure during that quarter-of-an-hour
that Richard Manx is not up to any of
his little games. You understand me&mdash;we
want to be sure that he is in his garret, smoking
his pipe, or saying his prayers, or reading
a good book. You and Fanny between you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
can do that part of the business for us&mdash;I
leave you to manage how. I wouldn&rsquo;t presume
to dictate to <em>you</em>. If ever you&rsquo;ve a
mind to give lessons in <em>my</em> way of business,
you may count on me as a pupil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can do what you ask,&rdquo; said Becky;
&ldquo;but how are we to let you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the window of the first floor front
open. If Richard Manx is safe in his room,
let fly a bit of newspaper out of the window&mdash;I
shall see it, and know what it means. If
there&rsquo;s danger&mdash;if at any time within a
quarter-of-an-hour of the newspaper flying
out of the window, Richard Manx is up to
any of his games, such as going out of his
room through the ceiling instead of through
the door, or prowling about the roof when he
ought to be in bed&mdash;throw one of these little
balls of red worsted out of the window.
That will be a danger signal, and we shall
know what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask you one question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dozen if you like&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t promise
to answer them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you may answer this one. Is the
gentleman who employs you taking an active
part in what is going to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, Miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is near here!&rdquo; exclaimed Becky.
She could not restrain herself from looking
this way and that through the darkness, but
she saw nothing but shadows. Not a human
being except the man beside her was visible
to her sight. &ldquo;O, if I could see him only for
a moment!&rdquo; she murmured softly, but not so
softly that the detective did not hear the
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best not, Miss,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known
the finest schemes upset just in the same way.
There&rsquo;s only one thing to be thought of&mdash;when
that&rsquo;s done, the time is all before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, I feel,&rdquo; said Becky, with a
sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in now, and do what you
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective stepped on to the pavement,
and when the street door was closed, stationed
himself by the railings of the parody of a
garden which occupied the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Square. He kept his eyes fixed on the first
floor window until he saw fluttering from it
a piece of newspaper. His professional instinct
caused him to pick this piece of paper
from the ground, so that it should not fall
into the hands of an enemy; then he took
from his pocket a pocket-handkerchief and
waved it in the air. During his conversation
with Becky, and up to this moment, his
movements had not been disturbed, and no
man or woman had appeared in the Square;
but now, in answer to his signal, a man made
his way towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said the detective; &ldquo;get in as
quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did not reply; accompanied by
the detective, he walked up to the house in
which the murder had been committed, and
inserted the key in the street door. The lock
was rusty, and he could not turn the key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; said the detective;
&ldquo;take the key out, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Producing a small bottle of oil and a
feather, he oiled the wards of the lock, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
allowing his attention to be distracted
from his observation of the first floor windows
of Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s house; he then rubbed a little
oil into the wards of the key, and putting it in,
turned the lock. The door of No.&nbsp;119 was
open to receive the new tenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word, sir,&rdquo; said the detective; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no danger at present. Nothing can come
within fifty yards of us without my being
warned of it. Are you quite determined to
pass these two nights in the house alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite determined&mdash;this night and
to-morrow night, and as many more as may
be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a man handy&mdash;a man you can
trust, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I require no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Don&rsquo;t forget the whistle
if you require help. There&rsquo;ll be no danger
in the day; it&rsquo;s the night you&rsquo;ll have to be
careful of. At one o&rsquo;clock in the morning
you&rsquo;ll find the basket lowered into the
area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well; but you had best remain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the spot for a few moments till I see if I can
get into the area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into the deserted house, and shut
himself in. Before he took a step inwards
he sat on the floor, and pulled off his boots,
and with these in his hands rose, and groped
towards the basement stairs. Downstairs he
crept in his stocking feet, and, after listening
for a moment or two, obtained a light from a
noiseless match, and lighted the lamp in a
policeman&rsquo;s lantern. By its aid he found his
way through a small door, which he opened
with difficulty, into the area. He looked up,
and was instantly accosted by the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no difficulty in the way,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it was that Frederick Holdfast, the
new tenant, took possession of the house in
which his father had been foully murdered.</p>

<p>Silently he re-entered the kitchen, closing
behind him the door which led into the area.
The place was damp and cold, but his agitation
was so intense that he was oblivious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
personal discomfort. Even when the rats ran
over his stocking feet he was not startled.
He had brought a bundle in with him, which
he placed upon the table and unpacked. It
contained food and wine, but not sufficient
for the time he intended to remain in the
house. This was to be supplied to him in the
basket which the detective promised to lower
into the area in a couple of hours. In his
breast pocket was a revolver, which he examined
carefully. So cautious was he in his
proceedings that, before he unpacked his food
and examined his revolver, he blocked the
stairs which led from the kitchen to the
ground floor by chairs, the removing or
scattering of which would have warned him
that he was not the only person in the house.</p>

<p>Presently he nerved himself to undertake a
task which sent thrills of horror through his
veins, which brought tears of anguish to his
eyes, and sighs of pity and grief to his lips.
He opened the door of the servant&rsquo;s bedroom,
a cupboard as small as that which Becky
occupied in the next house; he tracked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his eyes the direction which a mortally-wounded
man would take from the kitchen
door to the door of this miserable bedroom.
He followed the track, examining it with
agonised care, and knelt down before the
stains of blood which marked the spot upon
which his murdered father had fallen in his
death agony. Time had not worn away the
stains, and Frederick&rsquo;s suffering and sympathy
made them clearer to his sight than they
could possibly have been to the sight of any
other living being. For a long time he remained
kneeling by this fatal, palpable,
indelible shadow&mdash;remained as if in prayer,
and overpowering self-communing. And,
indeed, during the time he so knelt, with this
shadow of his father&rsquo;s body in his eyes, and
weighing as an actual weight upon his heart,
causing him to breathe thickly and in short
hurried gasps, dim pictures of his childhood
passed before him, in every one of which his
father appeared in an affectionate and loving
guise. And all the while these sweeter
presentments were visible to his inner sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his father dead, with the blood oozing from
his fatal wounds, lay before him with horrible
distinctness. When he rose, and moved a few
paces off, not only the shadow but the very
outlines of a physical form seemed to be lying
at his feet. The dying face was raised to his,
the dim eyes looked into his, the limbs
trembled, the overcharged breast heaved;
and when, after closing his eyes and opening
them again, he compelled himself, because of
the actual duty before him, to believe that it
was but the trick of a sympathetic imagination,
he could not rid himself of the fancy that his
father&rsquo;s spirit was hovering over him, and
would never leave him until his task was accomplished.</p>

<p>He tracked the fatal stains out of the
kitchen, and up the stairs to the passage to
the street door, and noted the stains upon the
balustrade, to which his father had clung as
he staggered to his death. As he stood in the
passage he fancied he heard a stifled movement
in one of the rooms above. Hastily he
shut out the light of his lamp, and stood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
deep darkness, listening for a repetition of the
sound. It did not reach him, but as he leant
forward, with his head inclined, and his hand
upon his revolver, the church clock proclaimed
the hour of midnight. Clear, strong
and deep, and fraught with unspeakable
solemnity, the bell tolled the hour which
marks the tragedy and the sorrow of life.
Shadows and pictures of sad experiences, and
of pathetic and tragic events, which were
not in any way connected with him, crowded
upon his mind. It appeared as if the records
of years were brought before him in every
fresh tolling of the bell, and when the echo
of the last peal died away, a weight which
had grown well nigh intolerable was lifted
from his soul. Then, his thoughts recurring
to the sound which he had fancied he heard
in the room above, he mentally asked himself
whether the murderer had paused to listen to
the tolling of the midnight hour, and whether
any premonition of the fate in store for him
had dawned upon his guilty mind?</p>

<p>For awhile nothing further disturbed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Lying upon the stairs for fully five minutes,
he convinced himself that as yet no other
human being but himself was in the house.
Turning the light of his lantern on again, he
continued his examination of his father&rsquo;s last
movements up the stairs to the first floor.
No need for him to doubt which was the
room his father had occupied. The stains of
blood led him to the very door, and here
again he shut out the light of his lamp, and
listened and looked before he ventured to
place his hand upon the handle. Silence
reigned; no glimmer of light was observable
through the chinks and crevices of the door.
Still in darkness, he turned the handle and
entered the room. He had disturbed no one;
he was alone.</p>

<p>Cautiously he let in the light, but not to its
full capacity. An amazing sight greeted him.</p>

<p>None of the furniture in the house had
been removed, and everything his father had
used during his fatal tenancy was in the room.
The piano, the table at which he sat and
wrote, the chairs, the bed, were there&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not in the condition in which they had been
left. A demon of destruction appeared to have
been at work. The bed was ripped open, the
paper had been stripped from the walls, the
coverings of the chairs were torn off, and the
chairs themselves broken to pieces, the table
was turned on end, the interior of the piano
had been ransacked, the very keys were
wrenched away&mdash;in the desperate attempt to
discover some hidden thing, some hidden
document upon which life and death might
hang. More than this. The carpet had been
taken up, and a few of the boards of the floor
had been wrenched away, and the dust
beneath searched amongst. But this was
recent work; the greater part of the room
was still boarded over.</p>

<p>Frederick Holdfast had no intention himself
of immediately commencing a search; he
knew that it would be dangerous. For a
certainty Richard Manx intended to continue
it without delay, and was only waiting for a
favourable opportunity to leave his attic.
This thought induced Frederick to consider in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
what way he could best watch the villain&rsquo;s
movements, without being himself detected.
To do this in the room itself was impossible.
There was no chance by the window; it could
be done only from the ceiling or from the
adjoining room. To effect an opening in the
ceiling in so short a time as he had at his
disposal was impracticable, and even could it be
done, there were dangerous chances of detection.
After a little reflection, he decided that
it could be best done from the adjoining room,
and the moment this was decided upon he saw
that Richard Manx had to some extent assisted
him. The laths which separated the rooms
were fragile, the plaster was thinly spread;
many of the laths in the dividing wall had
been laid bare by the stripping of the paper.
He stood up on the bed, and without an appreciable
effort, thrust his finger between the
laths, and through the wall paper of the adjoining
apartment, choosing that part of the
wall which would afford him a favourable
point of espionage. Alighting from the bed,
he carefully obliterated the marks of footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on the clothes, and then left the
room for the one adjoining. The door was
unlocked, and the key was in the inside.
More from the locality than from the aperture,
so securely small had he made it, he saw at
once that it was practicable, and he ascertained
by moving the table close to the wall, that a
safe footing was afforded for his watch. This
contented him, and for a time he rested.</p>

<p>There were still no signs of Richard Manx.
One o&rsquo;clock had struck, and remembering
that at that hour the basket of food was
to be lowered into the area, he hastened
downstairs, and arrived just in time to
receive it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is quiet here,&rdquo; said the
detective, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Is our
friend at work?&rdquo; meaning by &ldquo;our friend,&rdquo;
Richard Manx.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Frederick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, he will be presently,&rdquo; said the detective;
&ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t commence till he thinks
everybody&rsquo;s asleep, and Mrs. Preedy has only
been home for about ten minutes. She&rsquo;s as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
fond of a gossip as a cat is of mice. She&rsquo;s had
an extra glass, I think. Are you quite comfortable,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Frederick, and put an end to
the conversation by wishing the detective
good night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a plucky one,&rdquo; mused the detective,
as he resumed his watch; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s working
for a prize worth winning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The food in the basket was sufficient for
one man&rsquo;s wants for nearly a week, and
Frederick, partaking of a little, went softly
upstairs to the drawing room. He took the
precaution of locking the door, and, mounting
the table, waited for events.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. At half-past one
Richard Manx entered the room in which Mr.
Holdfast had been murdered.</p>

<p>Frederick did not instantly recognise him,
his disguise was so perfect, but when he removed
his wig, the watcher saw his enemy,
Pelham, before him.</p>

<p>The wronged and persecuted man had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
schooled himself well. Though his heart
beat furiously and his blood grew hot, he
suffered no sound to escape him. He had
fully made up his mind, in the event of
Richard Manx discovering a document, to
steal upon him unaware, and wrest it from
him. He did not doubt his power to do as
much; in physical strength he was the match
of three such men as Pelham. His chief
anxiety, in the event of anything being discovered,
was that it should not be destroyed.</p>

<p>Richard Manx used no precaution in the
method of entering the room, except that he
placed his candle upon the floor in such a
way that its reflection could not reach the
window, which opened at the back of the house.
This lack of precaution was in itself a sufficient
proof that his search had been long continued,
and was a proof also that he considered himself
safe in the deserted house.</p>

<p>He was evidently in a discontented mood; he
looked around the room sullenly and savagely,
but in this expression Frederick detected a
certain helplessness and fear which denoted
that he was ill at ease. That he was growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
tired of his task was clear, for he resumed it
with an impatience and a want of system
which might have prevented its successful
accomplishment, even if he were on the threshold
of discovery. Frederick, from his point
of observation, had an uninterrupted view of
his proceedings. He had brought with him a
quantity of tools, and by the aid of these he
set to work removing the flooring boards,
with but little noise, one after another, searching
eagerly in the rubbish beneath. With no
success, however. Every now and then, as
though tired of this part of his search, he
rose, and examined the furniture in the room,
suspicious that some hiding place might have
escaped him. He muttered as he worked, but
for a time his mutterings did not reach
Frederick&rsquo;s ears. After more than an hour&rsquo;s
labour, he took from a cupboard a bottle of
spirits and a glass, and helped himself liberally.
Then, dirty and begrimed as he was, and with
beads of perspiration on his face, he sat down
and consulted a pocket book, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
added up a number of figures. &ldquo;Five
hundred,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, &ldquo;seven-fifty,
eight hundred, a thousand, twelve hundred,
fourteen hundred and twenty.&rdquo; He came to
the end of his reckoning, and glared at the
figures as at a mortal enemy. Then
from the same pocket-book he took out a
packet of bank notes, and counted them over
till he reached the total, fourteen hundred and
twenty. Frederick held the true key to these
proceedings. The sum of fourteen hundred
and twenty pounds represented the whole of
Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s wealth, the payment and reward
of a life of villainy, and perhaps of blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be somewhere,&rdquo; muttered the man,
replacing the book in his pocket; &ldquo;he wrote
every day he was here. It was proved at the
inquest. What has he done with his infernal
scribble? If it is found by a stranger, and we
are in the country, it will be death to us.
Devil! devil! devil!&rdquo; and he struck at the
table in his passion, and then, alarmed at the
sound, glared round with a terror-stricken
face, with the air of a criminal overtaken by
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>His fears allayed, he worked on again at the
boards of the floor, making but slow progress.
Three o&rsquo;clock struck, and still he continued
his work, and still was watched by the son of
the murdered man. Half-past three&mdash;four&mdash;half-past
four; and Richard Manx rose from
his knees, and gave up his task for the night.
Many times during his search had he drank
from the bottle of spirits, but what he drank
appeared to affect him only through his tongue,
which became more loquacious and less guarded.
Once more he counted his bank-notes, grudgingly,
greedily, and muttered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall give me five hundred to-day&mdash;this
very morning; that will make nineteen
hundred and twenty&mdash;say eighteen hundred
clear, to break the bank at Monaco. If she
likes to come with me, she can. I am sick
of this game; there&rsquo;s too much to lose. To-morrow
night shall be my last night here.
I have searched every inch of this cursed
room, and I throw it up. It is a slave&rsquo;s
work, not a gentleman&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He certainly
looked as little like a gentleman as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
human being could, and his words proclaimed
the utter villainy of his nature.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much danger in it,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;If the police were to take it in
their heads to make another examination of
this house, or if that weak idiot, Frederick
Holdfast, were to turn up, I should find myself
in the hole. And <em>she</em> should, too; I&rsquo;d
make her suffer with me. A nice reward for
all my scheming in America! Well, it kept
them apart&mdash;I can count that to my credit.
But for me, the old dotard and Frederick
must have met. I owed him one for the part
he played in the Sydney Campbell affair in
Oxford&mdash;I owed him one, and I have paid it.
And if I had him here, I&rsquo;d serve him as I
served&mdash;&rdquo; He did not conclude his sentence;
a sudden terror seized him, and he shook like
a man in an ague. &ldquo;I could have sworn I
heard a voice,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; For
a few moments he did not move; his feet were
transfixed to the ground. By a strong effort
he recovered himself, and a ghastly smile disfigured
his face. &ldquo;To-morrow night shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the last,&rdquo; he said! &ldquo;I swear it! I&rsquo;ll commence
to enjoy my life again. This is not the
only country in the world.&rdquo; And, shading
the light of his candle with his hand, he left
the room.</p>

<p>Frederick Holdfast did not move from his
post till he had given Richard Manx ample
time to reach his garret in the next house.
Then he descended with difficulty, for his limbs
were cramped. As he stepped from the table
to the ground his foot slipped, and the table
overbalanced, fell with a crash on its side. He
congratulated himself upon his forethought in
waiting till Richard Manx was out of hearing,
but not knowing what might be the consequences
of the noise&mdash;for it might have disturbed
the inmates of either, or of both, the
adjoining houses&mdash;he unlocked the door, and
made his way as quickly as he could, consistent
with necessary caution, to the basement,
where in the course of another hour he sought
a little rest, with his revolver firmly clenched
in his hand.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">MRS. HOLDFAST INSISTS UPON BECOMING AN
ACTIVE PARTNER.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> following night&mdash;the night which Mr.
Pelham had sworn should be the last of
his search, and the last upon which he would
continue his disguise as Richard Manx&mdash;this
accomplished villain carried out his intention
of coming home to his garret in Mrs.
Preedy&rsquo;s house much earlier than usual. In
fact, it was not more than half-past eight as
he turned one of the streets which branched
into Great Porter Square. He was in good
spirits, despite that the night was as wretched
and gloomy as the most despondent mortal
could maliciously&mdash;out of hatred for his
species&mdash;have desired. All day long the rain
had continued without intermission; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thoroughfares were in a deplorable condition
of mud and slush, and those persons whose
avocations did not compel them to be out in
the streets, gladly availed themselves of the
comforts of a fireside at home. These are
not the occasions, especially in a city so
crowded and selfish as London, when people
are in the mood to be amiable and obliging,
and it was therefore the more remarkable that
Richard Manx, by no means a gracious being
as a rule, should have walked to his lodgings
in a glad and pleasant frame of mind. The
fact was, good fortune had smiled upon him.
He had had a long interview with Mrs.
Holdfast, who on this very day had come into
possession of a large sum of money, realised
from certain of her late husband&rsquo;s securities&mdash;shares
in railway companies which had
been delivered to her, as his sole heir and
executrix. It was, indeed, no less a sum than
twelve thousand pounds, and of this she had,
in compliance with Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s urgent
demands, given him a cheque for fifteen
hundred pounds, the exact sum, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
declared, necessary to clear himself from
pressing debts and liabilities. This cheque
he had forthwith converted into Bank of
England notes, and they were safe in his
pocket, with his other savings, with which he
intended to make a large fortune at Monaco.
Mrs. Holdfast had also consented to sell off
her London house, and accompany him on
a tour of pleasure. She, as well as he, was
tired of the humdrum days; she sighed for
excitement and adventure; the pleasure
grounds of Europe were open to her, and
now that she was a widow, and still young
and beautiful, and now that the terrible
anxieties of the past twelve months were at
an end, she determined to enjoy her life as
such a pretty woman should. There was
another reason why she wished to get away
from London, and indeed from England
altogether, for a while. Since little Fanny
had accosted her by the name of Grace, she
did not feel herself safe. There was danger
in the mere utterance of the name, and there
was security in absence from spots in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
other persons, more cunning than a simple
child like Fanny, might by some chance
recognise her. She thought it would be as
well to take the child with her; Fanny was a
bright, clever little creature, and might prove
useful, and if she got tired of her, it would be
easy to lose her on the Continent, or place
her in a situation where her babbling, if she
were inclined to babble, could do no harm.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham had visited her at noon in a
spirit the reverse of that in which he left her.
She had been most amiable and vivacious,
and fell in joyfully with his plans, when he
had expected her to be obstinate and ill-tempered,
and inclined to thwart him. Then,
he had intended to ask her for a cheque for
five hundred pounds, and improving the
opportunity, had obtained fifteen hundred. No
wonder that he sang a little song to himself
as he turned into Great Porter Square. Had
a beggar solicited charity from him he might
have obtained a small piece of silver, but it is
the misfortune of human affairs that fitting
opposites are rarely brought into fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
conjunction, and the beggar not being
forthcoming, Richard Manx&rsquo;s charitable spell
had no opportunity of airing itself. He was
within a few doors of his lodging-house when
a woman, who had walked quickly after him,
and was out of breath with the exertion, laid
her hand on his arm, and wished him good
evening.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">MRS. HOLDFAST INSISTS UPON BECOMING AN
ACTIVE PARTNER&mdash;(CONTINUED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Richard Manx</span>, as a man of gallantry,
was generally ready for any adventure
with the fair sex which offered itself, but on
the present occasion, despite his disposition
to be amiable, he shrank within himself at
being thus suddenly accosted. The intrusion
of an unexpected voice&mdash;which at the moment
he did not recognise&mdash;upon his
thoughts awoke him to a sense of danger.
He therefore walked on without replying,
shaking the woman&rsquo;s hand from his arm; but
was almost immediately brought to a standstill
by the sound of the woman&rsquo;s steps hurrying
after him.</p>

<p>She wore a cloak, with a hood to it, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was thrown over her head; in her haste the
hood fell back, and her fair face, no longer
hidden, shone out from masses of light hair,
in the disorder of which was a certain picturesqueness
which heightened the effect of
her beauty. As her hood fell back, Richard
Manx turned and recognised her.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Holdfast, the widow of the
murdered man.</p>

<p>He uttered an exclamation of alarm, and
with a frightened look around, pulled the
hood over her head to hide her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mad woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;do
you want to ruin us? What brings you
here?&rdquo; Then a sudden thought drove all
the blood from his face. &ldquo;Has anything
happened?&rdquo; he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>She laughed at his agitation. &ldquo;Nothing
has happened,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;except that I
am worn out with sameness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what in the devil&rsquo;s name brings you
here?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame, Pelham,&rdquo; she said, lightly,
&ldquo;to be so rude to a lady! What brings me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
here? I have told you. I am worn out
with sameness. Sitting down with nothing
to do, without excitement, in a house as dull
and quiet as a doll&rsquo;s cradle, doesn&rsquo;t suit me.
I was not cut out for that sort of life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have waited a little,&rdquo; he
grumbled, somewhat reconciled to find that
they were not being observed; &ldquo;you were
sure of another sort of life presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it, thought I to myself, without
waiting,&rdquo; she said, recklessly, &ldquo;and I feel
better already. Running away from my
doll&rsquo;s cradle without preparation, with an
idea in my head I am going to carry out, has
put new life into me. My blood isn&rsquo;t creeping
through my veins; it is dancing, and I
am alive once more. Really now I feel as if
I should like to waltz with you round the
Square!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite mad?&rdquo; he cried, holding
her still by force, but unable to refrain from
admiration of her wild flow of spirits. &ldquo;We
have but a few hours to wait. Can&rsquo;t you
content yourself for a little while? What is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this insane idea of yours which you are going
to carry out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To spend the evening with you, my dear,&rdquo;
she replied gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Great Porter Square. Where else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While this conversation was proceeding, he
had led her in an opposite direction from the
house in which he lodged, and they were now
on the other side of the Square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am sure you are mad,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Do you know what I have to do to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I am curious to
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I keep it to myself; but you will hear of
it, and when you do you will laugh. Shall I
leave behind me a danger hanging over my
head&mdash;and yours? A secret that one day
may be discovered, and bring ruin and death
to me&mdash;and you? No, no; they make a
mistake in the mettle of Dick Pelham if they
think he is going to leave a trap-door open
for himself to fall into.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should fall also, Pelham!&rdquo; she said half-questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; you would come down with
me. It couldn&rsquo;t be helped, I fear. I have
a kind of dog-in-the-manger feeling for you.
If I can&rsquo;t have you myself, I&rsquo;ll not leave you
to another man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be helped, I suppose,&rdquo; she said,
shrugging her shoulders; &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t
matter to me so long as I am enjoying
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said he, in a decided
tone; &ldquo;go home now, and get your trinkets
and dresses in order, for by to-day week we&rsquo;ll
be out of this dull hole. We&rsquo;ll live where
the sun shines for the future. Hurry now,
and off with you. I have a serious night&rsquo;s
work before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help you in it,&rdquo; she said, in a tone
as decided as his own. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bit of use
bullying, Pelham. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.
I haven&rsquo;t seen your room in No.&nbsp;118, and I
intend to see it. I have a right to, haven&rsquo;t
I? The wonder is I have kept away so long;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and this is the last night I shall have the
chance. I was curious before, but I&rsquo;m a
thousand times more curious now, and if you
were to talk all night you wouldn&rsquo;t put me
off. You are going to do something bold&mdash;all
the better; I&rsquo;ll be there to see, and I dare
say I can be of assistance to you. We are in
partnership, and I insist upon being an active
partner. How do I know but that you have
been deceiving me all this while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you
haven&rsquo;t a pretty girl hidden in that garret
of yours, and that you don&rsquo;t want to run
away with her instead of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealous!&rdquo; he cried, with a gratified laugh;
&ldquo;after telling me a dozen times lately that
you hated the sight of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s privilege. If you don&rsquo;t
understand us by this time, it is too late for
you to begin to learn. Pelham, I am coming
up with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are determined?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As ever a woman was in this world. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you run from me now, and enter the house
without me, I&rsquo;ll follow you, and knock at the
door, and inquire for Mr. Richard Manx;
and if they ask me who I am, I&rsquo;ll say I am
<em>Mrs.</em> Richard Manx.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you would,&rdquo; he said, looking
down into her face, and not knowing whether
to feel angry or pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, as truly as I am a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it, then,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t know how to get you into the house
without being observed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier. All the time we&rsquo;ve been
talking I haven&rsquo;t seen half-a-dozen people.
Choose a moment when nobody&rsquo;s about; open
the door quickly, and I&rsquo;ll slip in like an eel.
Before you shut the door, I&rsquo;ll be at the top of
the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me warn you once more; there is
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better; there&rsquo;s excitement in
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t find what I&rsquo;ve been hunting
for these weeks past, I intend to carry out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
a desperate design, which if successful&mdash;and it
must be; I&rsquo;ll make it so&mdash;will place us in a
position of perfect safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Pelham; I never thought you had
so much pluck. I will help you in everything
you have to do. Now let us get into the
house. I am drenched through. You can
make a fire, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cautioned and instructed her how to
proceed, and they walked to No.&nbsp;118, he leading,
and she but a step or two behind.
Seeing no person near, he opened the door
with one turn of the key, and she glided
rapidly past him, and was on the stairs, and
really nearly at the top of the house, feeling
her way along the balustrades, before
he was up the first flight. Safely within the
miserable room he had hired, he turned the
key, and lighted a candle; then, pointing to
wood and coals, he motioned her to make a
fire. The stove was so small she could not
help laughing at it, but he whispered to her
savagely to stop her merriment, and not to
utter a sound that could be heard outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
room. The fire lighted, she sat before it, and
dried her clothes as well as she could, while
he busied himself about the room. Then he
sat down by her side, and explained his plans.
As long as suspicion could be averted from
them, and as long as they were sure that no
document written by Mr. Holdfast between
the date of his taking lodgings in No.&nbsp;119
Great Porter Square, and the date of his
death, could be produced against them&mdash;so
long were they safe. Suspicion was averted
from them, as they believed, and they had
every reason to believe that the murder would
take its place, nay, had already taken its
place, upon the list of monstrous crimes,
the mystery of which would never be
brought to light. Their only danger, then,
lay in the probable discovery of the
supposed document for which Pelham, as
Richard Manx, had so long been searching.
From what had been made known by the
press and the police of Mr. Holdfast&rsquo;s movements
after his taking up his residence in No.
119, and from what they themselves knew, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was almost impossible that such a document,
if it had existence, could have been taken
out of the house. Pelham had sought for it
unsuccessfully. What then, remained to be
done for safety? To set fire to the house in
which it was hidden, to burn it to the ground,
and thus blot out from existence all knowledge
of their crime.</p>

<p>This was Pelham&rsquo;s desperate plan, and this
deed it was he intended to perpetrate to-night.
For a few hours longer he would search the
room in which Mr. Holdfast was murdered,
and then, everything being prepared to prevent
failure, he would fire the house, and in
the confusion make his escape, and disappear
for ever from the neighbourhood. Mrs.
Holdfast&rsquo;s unexpected appearance on the
scene complicated matters&mdash;the chief difficulty
being how to get her away, during the confusion
produced by the fire, without being
observed. But when, unwillingly, he had
given an enforced consent to her wild whim
of keeping in his company on this eventful
night, he had thought of a way to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the difficulty. In her woman&rsquo;s dress, and
with her attractive face, he could scarcely
hope that she would escape observation;
but he had in his room a spare suit of his
own clothes, in which she could disguise
herself, and with her face and hands blackened,
and her hair securely fastened and
hidden beneath a soft felt wideawake hat
which hung in his garret, he had no fear
that she would be discovered.</p>

<p>She entered into his plans with eagerness,
and the adventure in which she was engaged
imparted a heightened colour to her face and
a deeper brilliancy to her eyes. As she leant
towards the fire, with the reflection of its
ruddy glow in her features, an uninformed
man, gazing at her only for a moment, would
have carried away with him a picture of
beauty and innocence so enduring that his
thoughts would often have wandered to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are your clothes,&rdquo; said Pelham;
&ldquo;when we are ready I will mount to the
roof, and wait till you are dressed. Then I
will come and assist you up. I have two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
three journeys to make to the next house
before we re-commence the search. See what
I have here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He unlocked the box in the corner which
Becky had vainly tried to open, and took from
it a tin can filled with pitch, two small cans of
inflammable oil, and a packet of gunpowder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These will make the old place blaze,&rdquo; he
said, laughing. &ldquo;It will be a good job done
if all Great Porter Square is burnt down.
The landlady of this house ought to pay me
a per-centage upon her insurance. The fire
will be the making of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we begin?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner than usual,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;At
about half-past ten. The night is so bad that
the Square will be pretty well deserted; and
there is no one in this house to disturb us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not neglect the precaution of going
to the door occasionally and listening, but
he saw and heard nothing to alarm him.
Exactly at half-past ten he bade Grace dress
as quickly as possible in the suit of his
clothes, and to disguise herself to the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
her ability. Her own woman&rsquo;s dress she was
to tie up in a bundle and bring with her
into the next house. He mounted to the
roof, and she handed him the cans and the
packet which were to ensure the destruction
of No.&nbsp;119. Then she proceeded to disguise
herself.</p>

<p>It was a task exactly to her taste. She took
the greatest pleasure in making herself look as
much as possible like a young man, and as she
gazed at herself in the broken bit of looking-glass
fastened to the wall, she said aloud,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Gracie, you make a very
pretty boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wore a great many trinkets, which she
wrapped in paper, and put into her pockets,
but the novelty of her disguise, and the inconvenient
space in which she effected it,
caused her to drop two of these, a ring and an
earring, and although she searched the floor
carefully, she could not find them. Her hair
she twisted into a tight knot at the top of her
head, and the wideawake completely covered
it. Richard Manx made his appearance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
trap-door above, and asked if she was ready.
She answered that she was, and he assisted
her up, lifting her, indeed, almost bodily from
the chairs upon which she stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a little lump of weakness you are!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t weigh above a
hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carefully he led her over the roof, and down
the trap-door, into the next house. Standing
in the dark with him in the garret of this
tenement, he felt that she trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to show the white feather,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;you had better turn back.
There is time even now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little did she imagine how much hung upon
the opportunity offered her. She refused it,
saying that she had experienced a slight chill,
and that she would go on; so he led her,
white-faced now and shaking in every limb,
down the stairs to the room in which her
husband had been murdered.</p>

<p>Its appearance, while it bewildered, afforded
her relief. Had it been in order, as she had
seen it when her husband had occupied it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
she could not have controlled her agitation;
but it was so torn up, the work of destruction
had been so wanton, that she could scarcely
recognise it as the same room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any brandy, Pelham?&rdquo; she
asked, careful, as he had directed her, not to
raise her voice.</p>

<p>He had a bottle with him, and he gave her
some in a glass, upon which her courage returned,
and she shook her head defiantly, as
much as to say, &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been idle, you see,&rdquo; said Pelham,
pointing around. &ldquo;Amuse yourself while I
do what is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; was the villainous
work of scattering the gunpowder about, disposing
of the pitch, and pouring the oil upon
the walls and flooring of the passage. At the
conclusion of this part of his scheme there
was still a great deal of inflammable material
left, and these he placed aside, the pitch and
the oil in the tins, and the gunpowder, loose,
in its paper packet, in the room in which he
was at work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure there is no one but ourselves
in the house?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen for yourself,&rdquo; replied Pelham. &ldquo;If
you like you can go downstairs and look. I&rsquo;ll
ensure you against anything but ghosts and
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shuddered, and, to divert her thoughts,
endeavoured to take a practical interest in the
search for the hidden document. It was difficult,
in the state of the room, to move about,
and she soon grew wearied. She threw herself
upon the bed, and longed impatiently for
the time when the crowning touch would be
given to the wicked work in which she had
insisted upon becoming an active partner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST MAKES THE DISCOVERY.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Frederick Holdfast</span> slept until late in
the morning. Awaking, he looked at
his watch, which marked the hour of eleven.
He did not begrudge the time spent in sleep.
It had refreshed and strengthened him, and
he knew it would not be prudent on his part
to work during the day in any room in which
he would run the risk of being observed by the
neighbours. He had not been disturbed;
when he awoke his revolver was in his hand,
and perfect stillness reigned throughout the
house.</p>

<p>In his state of mind inaction was a torture
to him, and he could not content himself with
sitting idly down. Imprisoned as it were,
while daylight lasted, to the basement, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the rooms in which passers-by in the Square
above could not peer, he resolved to examine
carefully every inch of the floor and walls in
the kitchen and passage. The shutters of the
area-windows were closed, and darkness prevailed.
His lantern, therefore, served him in
as good stead by day as it had done by night;
he trimmed the lamp carefully, and prepared
for what he had no hope would be anything
but a fruitless task. He only undertook it,
indeed, for the purpose of occupying the
time during which he was shut out from the
upper part of the house, to the windows in
which there were no shutters. It comforted
him to think that his dear girl was within a
short distance of him; a few inches of wall
separated them, and they were thinking of
each other, praying for each other.</p>

<p>He commenced in the passage, tracking the
marks of his father&rsquo;s dying steps upon the
floor, and of his hands upon the walls. Inclined
as he was to the closest examination,
his attention was arrested by a slight scratch
upon the wall, which he found repeated, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
above and below, wherever his father had
rested his hand for support in his descent to
the kitchen. The scratch was very slight,
and was not to be found upon any part
of the wall which the dying man had
not touched with his hand. The fading
stains within which these scratches were
observable appeared to have been made
by a clenched hand; the marks of the
knuckles could be traced. The inference
Frederick Holdfast drew from these signs was
that his father had a distinct motive in keeping
his hand closed, and that the hand held something
he wanted to deposit in safe keeping
before life left his poor wounded body. It
was for this reason, then, Frederick argued,
following out the train of thought, as much
as for any other, that the mortally-wounded
man had, in his death-agony, made his way
to the kitchen, where he believed the servant
was asleep. In her hands he would place
the treasure his clenched hand guarded, and,
that supreme effort accomplished, he would
then be content to die, comforted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
thought that he left behind him a clue by
which the innocent might be saved and the
guilty punished. What was this treasure
which had been so carefully guarded by a
man who had but a few moments to live? He
had been unable to place it in the safe possession
of a friend to justice. Had it been
found by one whose interest it was to conceal
it, or had it escaped all eyes, to be discovered
by the son he had unwittingly wronged? This
last surmise was scarcely needed by Frederick
to prompt him to search in every unlikely
nook and cranny in the passage and stairs;
but when he raised the light to the kitchen
door, and saw there the fatal hand-mark, and
with it the almost imperceptible scratch repeated,
he knew that he had wasted his time,
and that whatever it was his father had held
in his hand he had carried into the kitchen
with him. To this room, therefore, he confined
his search, and after being occupied in
it for hours&mdash;until, indeed, he heard the
church clock strike five&mdash;was about to give it
up in despair, when his eyes fell upon what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
looked like a small piece of metal, firmly imbedded
in a crevice of the floor. It had evidently
been trodden into the crevice by heavy
boots, and it was with difficulty Frederick dug
it out. It proved to be a key, small enough
for a drawer in a desk.</p>

<p>Frederick immediately went into the passage
to ascertain whether he was right in his idea
that the scratches had been produced by this
key, and holding it between his knuckles, as
his father might have done, and placing his
hand upon the wall, he was satisfied of its
probability. It was not strange that an object
so small had escaped the notice of the police
or the people in the house. As the dying
man fell to the ground, the key may have
been struck out of his hand by the shock, and
being at some distance from the body, had
been trodden down into the crevice by the
policeman&rsquo;s feet. After that, nothing but
such a minute examination as Frederick had
carried out could have brought it to light.</p>

<p>Quick as his eager thought would allow him,
Frederick followed his train of argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in logical sequence. It was this key which
his father wished to place in the servant&rsquo;s
hands before he died; it was this key which
was to unravel the mystery of his life and
death in No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter Square. The
drawer of the desk which the key would unlock
contained the record which would make
all things clear. It had been in the house;
the furniture had not been removed; it was
still in the house. But not in the room
occupied by his father. If it were there,
Pelham would have been certain to have
found it. In that room every lock had been
forced, every scrap of paper examined. No!&mdash;The
document had been placed in another
room for safety. The murdered man, acquainted
with the character of the persons
who had brought disgrace upon him, had
taken the precaution to secure his written
thoughts and wishes from their prying
eyes. Mr. Pelham was working on a wrong
scent; his labour had been thrown away.
Frederick knew, from the inquiries of the
detective in his employ, that the adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
room to that his father had occupied&mdash;the
room from which he had, on the previous
night, watched the proceedings of his father&rsquo;s
murderer (for upon that point now Frederick
was morally convinced)&mdash;had, during the last
four days of his father&rsquo;s tenancy, been vacant.
What more likely than that this very room
contained a drawer which the key would fit?</p>

<p>He trembled with eagerness, feeling that he
was on the brink of discovery, and the shock
of these mental revelations, which a few
minutes would see verified, was so great that
a faintness stole over his senses. Then he remembered
that he had partaken of but little
food during the day. He knew not what was
before him in the night to come; he needed all
his strength.</p>

<p>He sat down resolutely, curbing his impatience,
and ate and drank his fill. When
he had finished his meal, he felt that he had
acted well and with prudence. He was ready
now for any emergency, equal to any effort.</p>

<p>It was by this time dark, and he could
move into the upper part of the house with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
comparative safety. All day long the rain
had been plashing into the area with a dismal
sound; the dreariness of the weather and the
dreariness of the house would have daunted
any man who had not a serious purpose to
sustain him. Frederick had held no further
communication with the detective; during
the day it was impracticable. But it had
been arranged between them that when night
came, the detective, if he had anything of importance
to communicate, should drop a letter
into the area, of course at such time and in
such a way as should afford no chance of
detection. Before going upstairs with his
precious key, Frederick cautiously opened
the door which led into the area, and saw
that a small packet of brown paper had been
dropped during the day. He picked it up
and opened it; there was a stone inside, and
round the stone a sheet of note paper, on
which was written, in the detective&rsquo;s handwriting:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. H. has received to-day a large sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
money. Her friend, Mr. P., was with her for
nearly two hours. Upon leaving her house
he drove to the City and cashed a cheque for
fifteen hundred pounds. He was in high
spirits. There is something in the wind; it
looks as if they are making preparations to
flit. Mrs. H. is getting together as much
ready money as she can lay her hands on. I
have no doubt she and Mr. P. have arranged
to-day to go away together. Nothing further
to say on that head. Your young lady friend
in No.&nbsp;118, Becky, is quite safe, but she
looks anxious. On your account, I guess.
Her little friend, Fanny, is a brick. We
shall be on the watch all night in the
Square. If you are in want of help, use
your whistle.&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<p>Not being in want of help at present,
Frederick destroyed the letter, and went
upstairs to the first floor. Opening the door
of the room his father had occupied, he saw
that no person had entered it during the day;
everything was as Pelham had left it early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the morning. Frederick, by the light of his
lantern, looked around for drawer or desk.
A chest of drawers was there, unlocked and
empty; a desk also, which had been broken
open, and which the key he had found would
not fit. As he left the room he saw, lying in
a corner of the wall, a large key. It was the
key of his father&rsquo;s room. He put it in the
lock, and it turned easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pelham would be astonished to-night,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;if, when he came, he found the
door locked against him. But that would be
putting him on his guard. I will open the
trap for him instead of closing it. Murderer!
Your hour is approaching!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He unlocked the door, and put the key in
his pocket, with no distinct intention, but
with an idea that it might in some way prove
useful. When in his thought the unspoken
words came to his mind, &ldquo;I will open the
trap for him instead of closing it,&rdquo; he had not
the dimmest comprehension of their awful
significance, or of the fearful manner in which
they were to be verified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>He entered the adjoining room in which he
had kept his long and painful watch on the
previous night. In the room was a sideboard,
and to this he first directed his attention.
The key he had found in the kitchen was too
small for either of the sideboards, and as they
were locked, he forced them open. There
was nothing inside but some mouldy biscuits
and a couple of old-fashioned decanters, with
dregs of wine in them. He felt about for
secret drawers, but found none. A cupboard
next attracted his attention, and he searched
it carefully. It contained plates and wine
glasses, a shell box and a shell caddy, with
views of Margate on them. Both were open,
and he discovered nothing on the shelves
which was likely to bring his search to a
successful issue. Before proceeding further
he thought&mdash;in case Pelham should take it
into his head to commence his work early on
this which he declared should be his last
night in No.&nbsp;119&mdash;it would be well to replace
the table which had fallen over when he
stepped from it. He raised it carefully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
replaced it on its carved feet. It was a round
table of Spanish mahogany, and was a contrast
to the other furniture in the room, being
old-fashioned and of ancient make. As he
raised it, one of the lower surfaces upon
which he placed his hand shifted slightly, and
the thought flashed through his mind that
there might be a drawer beneath. He stooped
and looked upward, and saw that his impression
was a correct one. A drawer was
there, evidently intended as a secret drawer;
it was locked. With trembling hands he
tried the key. It fitted the lock, turned, and
the drawer was open&mdash;and there, beneath his
eyes, were some sheets of folio paper, upon
which he recognised his dead father&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>

<p>He drew forth the sheets and rapidly
scanned them. They were in the form of a
diary, and contained the record of his father&rsquo;s
last days, or perhaps his last hours. Tears
filled his eyes as he gazed at the beloved
memorial of a dear one, from whose heart he
had been torn by the foulest treachery. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
dashed the tears away. No time now for
grief; a sterner duty than that of mourning
for the dead was before him. In his hands he
held the vindication of his good name, and,
he hoped, the means of bringing the guilty to
punishment. He must to work at once, and
read the words the dead had written for him.
He went down to the kitchen, and, setting the
door open so that no sound made in the house
should escape his ears, commenced the perusal
of his murdered father&rsquo;s diary.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">MR. HOLDFAST&rsquo;S DIARY.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Tuesday</span>, <i>1st July</i>.&mdash;I am once more in
London, after a long absence and much
wandering in America, where I sought in
vain for my dear son, Frederick, the son I
wronged and thrust from my house. Bitterly
have I repented of my error, and bitterly am
I punished for it.</p>

<p>Almost at the last moment, in New York, a
hope of success was held out to me. Returning
to my hotel there from New Orleans, in
which city, from information conveyed to me
in a letter from a stranger, I hoped to find
Frederick, I was informed that a gentleman
had called to see me. The description given
to me of this gentleman&mdash;who, the manager
of the hotel informed me, appeared to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
by no means prosperous circumstances&mdash;left
no doubt in my mind that it was my son.
He had, then, received the letters I sent to
him, directed to the New York Post-office,
and had at once sought me out. Unhappy
chance that caused me to be absent when he
called! I must have been a thousand miles
away at the time, following a false scent
supplied by a stranger. It has occurred to
me within these last few days, during my
voyage home, that an enemy may have been
at work in America to prevent a meeting
between me and my son. There is no
meanness, no wickedness, no baseness, to
which the wretched woman who calls me
husband, and her paramour, would not stoop.
And for the cunning necessary to keep me
and my son apart from each other, have I not
had sufficient proof that they are capable of
it? Strange that the suspicion did not occur
to me in America! Now that&mdash;perhaps too
late&mdash;it presents itself, it comes upon me with
singular force. The letter, written to me by
a stranger, which drove me so far from New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
York on a fruitless errand, was not the only
one I received conveying to me, gratuitously,
information which retarded instead of assisting
me in my purpose. They were all in
different handwriting, it is true, but may they
not have been written by one man? Even
were it otherwise, there is as little difficulty in
New York as there is in London in obtaining
agents to assist in the carrying out of any
villainous design. But now my mind is set
upon this suspicion of systematic deceit, I am
of the opinion that but one enemy was
engaged in it, and that that enemy is the
scoundrel Pelham, my wretched wife&rsquo;s accomplice.
If it be so, he must have followed
me to America, and watched my movements,
cunningly misdirecting them when he deemed
it necessary. Working against such an
enemy is working in the dark. It is my
unhappy fate that, alone, I have not the
courage to publicly proclaim my disgrace. I
should die under the shame of it. With my
son by my side I might be able, were no
other way open for a settlement, to nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
myself to any effort he might advise.
Without him I am powerless, and indeed,
were a public exposure forced upon me&mdash;were
I certain that by no other possible
means could I rid myself of this infamous
woman&mdash;my son&rsquo;s evidence would be necessary
to complete the case against her. But
before this terrible necessity is made clear to
me, every means must be adopted to settle
the unhappy affair in a private manner.
Never again could I hold up my head and
meet the gaze of my fellow-man were I to
hear my name and the shameful secrets of my
home shouted out in the streets by hawkers
of public news. My life would be blasted
indeed were I to see my dishonour publicly
proclaimed in the newspaper bills that are
displayed at every railway station in the
kingdom. Ah, then the son who renounced
my name, driven to it by my folly, my
incredulousness, my injustice, might deem
himself fortunate that he had done so before
it was dragged into the gutters, and covered
with ignominy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>I waited impatiently in my New York hotel
for my son to make a second call, but to my
great disappointment he did not again appear.
My letters, which he must have received,
were brief, but they explained my anxiety to
see him and to be reconciled with him. He
could not have followed me to New Orleans,
for I had taken the precaution so to arrange
my route as not to afford any stranger a clue
to my destination. In this I was actuated by
my overpowering desire to keep my family
affairs from public gaze&mdash;a more difficult
matter in America, where the newspaper
interviewer appears to be ubiquitous, than it
is in any other country in the world. On
the twelfth day of my last stay in the hotel,
exactly three weeks ago, I received news
which determined me to return immediately
to England. The news was startling and
overwhelming, and added another shame to
that which was already weighing me down.
My wife had given birth to a child. This
child is not mine. Imperative, therefore, was
the necessity of bringing the shameful matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to an end without delay. I took passage to
Liverpool in the &ldquo;Germanic,&rdquo; and before I
left New York I placed in the hands of the
manager of the hotel a letter for my son, to
be given to him privately, in case he should
call. The letter contained bank notes for
£200 and a sight draft for £500, payable to
bearer, and was to the effect that Frederick
was to follow me home by the earliest
possible opportunity. I instructed him in
the letter to take his passage to Liverpool,
and on his arrival there to inquire at the
post office for a letter, which I intended
should enable him to come to me at once. It
is because these proceedings have, up to the
present time, not led to a successful result,
and because of the suspicion that has obtained
a firm hold in my mind of some cunning
underhand plotting to prevent my son from
meeting me, that I think it best to keep a
record of what has been done and of what
is likely to take place.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Germanic&rdquo; made a rapid passage, and
on the day of my arrival in Liverpool I wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and sent to the post-office a letter for my son,
telling him to come to the Adelphi Hotel,
where I awaited him. I remained in Liverpool
six days, in the hope of seeing my son,
and my hope has not been fulfilled. Then I
came on to London, travelling by a night
train. Determining that my presence in the
City shall be known only to my son and my
wife, at least for a few days, which time I
shall employ in the endeavour to come to a
private arrangement with the woman who has
dishonoured me, I looked about for a lodging
in a neighbourhood where it is likely the
movements of a stranger may not be subjected
to curious inquiry. Within half-a-mile from
the railway terminus is Great Porter Square,
quiet and retired; it appears to be the very
locality I desire. The houses in this quiet
square are mostly lodging-houses, the landlords
and landladies of which are more
anxious about their rent than about the
characters of their tenants. In such a neighbourhood
men and women are doubtless in
the habit of coming and going, of appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and disappearing, without exciting curiosity.
Cards of rooms to let were in a great many
windows, and I selected a house, No.&nbsp;119, and
found, upon inquiry, that I could have a
bed-room on the first-floor, or one on the
second. I took the bedroom on the first-floor,
which is at the back of the house, and the
landlady informed me that by the end of the
week I could have the adjoining room, the
windows of which front the Square, as the
present occupant had given notice to leave.
But the back room will probably suit my purpose
for a while. I avoided giving the landlady
my name by paying her a month&rsquo;s rent
in advance, with which she appears perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>The moment I took possession of my room
I wrote two letters, one to my son at the
Liverpool post-office, the other to my wife.
In my letter to Frederick I simply said that I
am to be found for a few days at No.&nbsp;119,
Great Porter Square, and I desired him to
hasten to me at once, without communicating
with any person. I have in my previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
letters impressed upon him the importance of
secrecy. My letter to my wife also contained
my address. I told her that I have arrived
in London and that I am willing to come to
an arrangement with her which will no doubt
satisfy her, and which will keep our affairs
from scandal-mongers. I requested her to
call upon me at eleven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
morning. Until that hour, therefore, I have
nothing to do. The time will hang heavily,
and my only relief is in this diary.</p>

<p>I cannot read; I cannot sleep. Not alone
the shamefulness of my position, but the injustice
I inflicted upon my son, weighs upon
my spirits. If he were with me all
would be as well with me as it is possible
to be. If he were here, and I could ask
his forgiveness, and thus absolve him from the
solemn oath I compelled him to take, I should
feel strong once more, and equal to the awful
crisis. In spirit now, my son, I ask your forgiveness
most humbly. The sufferings I inflicted
upon you are, I well know&mdash;for certain
qualities in my nature are implanted in yours&mdash;irremediable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
but all that a repentant
father can do I will do. Forgive me, Frederick,
for my blindness. I have wronged not
only you, but the memory of your dear
mother. It appears to me as if my mad act
in allying myself with a creature so base has
cast even upon her pure soul a shadow of dishonour.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Wednesday, 2nd July.</i>&mdash;She has been here,
and is gone. Our interview was a long one,
and I apply myself now to a description of
what passed between us, setting down simply
that which is important to the momentous
issue before me. It is the only way in which
I can relieve the tedium of the dull, weary
hours I am condemned to pass alone.</p>

<p>She came into the room, closely veiled, and
stood with her back against the closed door.
She was calm and self-possessed. I trembled
so that I could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>I heard the question with amazement, not
at the words, but at the joyous tone in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it was asked. I did not answer, and she
threw up her veil, and looked at me with
eyes and face sparkling with animation and
delight. It was as though she was playing a
part in a masquerade. Never had I seen her
look so well. No trace of anxiety or disquietude
was observable in her. She was the
very picture of joyous health and beauty, an
embodiment of apparent innocence and peace
of mind. But in my eyes she was no longer
beautiful; I saw her soul through the mask
she presents to the world, and I knew that it
was corrupt and vile.</p>

<p>She advanced to me with her arms stretched
forward to embrace me, but I motioned her
back sternly, and she stood still and looked
at me with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;After this long
absence, to refuse to kiss me! Ah, you are
trying me, I see. You have not the heart to
say you do not love me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pointed to the door, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be best for both of us that our
interview shall not be interrupted. In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
houses as this the servants have an awkward
habit of sometimes opening the doors unawares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the hint, and locked the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; she said, removing her
hat and cloak, &ldquo;we are quite alone&mdash;quite,
quite alone! You see I am not afraid of you.
I thought you were only playing with my
feelings when you refused to embrace me.
What, you will not kiss me even now? You
have indeed grown cold and hard-hearted.
You were not so once, in the sweet days, not so
long ago, of our first acquaintanceship. And
how old you have grown&mdash;quite haggard!
My dear, gentlemen should not run away
from their wives. This should be a lesson to
you. I hope it will be&mdash;with all my heart I
hope it will be; indeed, indeed I do! Oh,
how I have suffered while you have been
away! And never to send me a letter&mdash;not
a single line to relieve my anxiety. It was
cruel of you&mdash;too, too cruel! I have had the
most horrible dreams of you. I dreamt you
were ill, and I could not get to you&mdash;that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
were in danger, and I could not help you&mdash;that
you were dead, without as much as
saying good-bye to your fond, faithful wife!
It was horrible, horrible! Really, my dear,
it would be a proper punishment if I refused
ever to speak another word to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you done with your trifling?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trifling!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You have been
absent from me and your home for months,
without sending me one message of affection,
and now that you return to London suddenly,
and take up your lodging in a mean house
like this, and I am pouring my heart out at
your feet, you call it trifling! Take care,
my dear&mdash;you may try my patience too far!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may try mine too far,&rdquo; I retorted.
&ldquo;Cast aside, if it is possible, your false airs
and affectations, and let us talk as business
people in a business way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for business, then,&rdquo; she said, still
smiling in my face, &ldquo;and not for love, you
summoned me here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no question of love between us,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
I replied, and was about to proceed when she
interrupted me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will force me to be as cold and hard-hearted
as yourself. The last time we were
together&mdash;alone, as we are now&mdash;yes, alone,
for you dared not, you dare not, speak in the
presence of a third party as you spoke to me
then!&mdash;you brought against me a number of
false accusations, and vowed that you would
never live with me again. If I had been a
man I would have killed you&mdash;do you hear?
I would have killed you, and the words you
addressed to me should have been the last
you would ever have spoken. But you took
advantage of my weakness, and you insulted
me as no woman in the world was ever
insulted. Is it to insult me again that you
have sent for me now to meet you here
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It pleased me that she should adopt this
tone. I could cope with her better when she
showed me her true nature. &ldquo;It is not of the
past that I wish to speak,&rdquo; I said, calmly, &ldquo;it
is of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the past must be spoken of,&rdquo; she
rejoined vehemently, &ldquo;and shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are determined, it must be so.
You will find me very forbearing. My only
wish is to put an end to this miserable business
for once and for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put an end to <em>me</em>, perhaps,&rdquo; she cried,
thrusting her face close to mine in contemptuous
defiance, &ldquo;for once and for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so far as my own
life is concerned. I wish to shut you out
from my life from this time forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you propose to do that?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By paying you for it,&rdquo; I replied, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to bid high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am prepared to bid high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not only the question of living,&rdquo;
she said, with a dark look, &ldquo;there is the
question of a woman&rsquo;s feelings to be considered.
You brought against me a charge
of unfaithfulness&mdash;you accused me of being
a vile woman, of low character and low
morals. Do you still believe it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I still believe it,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How brutally manly it is of you to be so
plain and concise! I can thank you, at least,
for your frankness, liar as you are! You
accused me of trumping up a designing untrue
story of my life when I first met you, for the
purpose of winning your sympathy. Do you
still believe it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I thank you? I know how I
could repay you if I were a man. It is
fortunate for you that I am not. You accused
me of setting a snare for your son, who knew
the true particulars of my life, you said, and
who wished to remove the shame I had
brought upon your name. My memory is
not bad, is it? Do you still believe all
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still believe it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think if she could have stabbed or
poisoned me, and caused me to die at that
moment, she would not have spared me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have seen
your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To my grief,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have not.
I should be happier if I could see him and
ask his forgiveness for the injustice I have
done him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The injustice you have done him through
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, through you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious, too, that you have not met
him,&rdquo; she said, and I noticed that she was
secretly watching my face as she spoke:
&ldquo;you are such a good business man, and you
went to America and remained there so long
in the hope of finding him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; I inquired.
&ldquo;How do you know, indeed, that I have been
in America all the time I have been absent
from England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My questions warned her that she had
made a mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People will talk,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
suppose that I have kept my mouth closed, or
that other persons have kept theirs, for
months, because you took it into your head
to run away from me. Upon my word, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was advised by friends to go to a magistrate,
and lay the case before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are as good in business matters as I
am; in some matters better. You followed
your own advice instead of the advice of
others, and you did not go to a magistrate.
I know your reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was my reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you, like myself, have no wish to
drag our private affairs before the public.
Once in the courts you will find it difficult to
escape them; to lay your life and character
bare to official gaze would not suit you. No,
I know how far I am compromised, and I
know how far you will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All at once she changed her tone. &ldquo;I am
bound to give way to you,&rdquo; she said, with an
assumption of humility, &ldquo;for you are my
husband. I have no wish to irritate you, or
to unsettle your mind more than it is already
unsettled. There are women who, for less
than you have said, for less than you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
done, would have put you into a private madhouse.
The delusions you have been under
are very serious to me, but I will bear them
as long as I can. If I were to tell any
official, any doctor, that, returning home
after a long absence, you never once inquired
for your child, born during your
absence, it would be a sufficient proof of
your insanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard in New York that you had a
child,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and it brought me home
earlier than I had intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind, thoughtful husband,&rdquo; she murmured,
vindictively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have avoided the subject,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;I would avoid it now. Shameless woman!
Not upon the head of an innocent child, of
whom I am not the father, do I desire to visit
the sin of the mother. It would have become
you better&mdash;if any suggestion that is good
and modest in woman could occur to you&mdash;to
have omitted all mention of your child.
Listen now to me with your best attention.
In the course I am adopting I am prompted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
by but one desire&mdash;to avoid the shame which
publicity would bring upon me. For that
reason have I kept my return home a secret
from every person but yourself with whom I
am acquainted in London; for that reason I
have taken this lodging in an obscure locality,
so that I may confer the more privately with
you, and endeavour to bring you to a true
sense of your position. Publicity will bring
shame to me; it will bring beggary to you&mdash;absolute
beggary. Let that fact sink into
your mind; ponder well over it; and while
you think of it let this declaration which I
am about to make have its due weight. If
you drive me to the extremity of forcing you
into a public court, and the case be decided
against you, as it must, no persuasion or
entreaty shall induce me to assist you to the
value of a shilling in your future. You will
have to depend absolutely upon yourself and
your vile associate for your means of living.
You compel me to hold out this threat, which,
under other circumstances, I should deem unmanly
and inhuman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> unmanly and inhuman,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why do you hold out such a threat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, as I have said, it is the only
means I can adopt to bring you to a proper
understanding of your position. Shame you
could bear, for you have already borne it,
and it has not touched your fatal beauty.&rdquo;
Her vain nature could not but be gratified at
this admission, and she bestowed upon me a
radiant smile. &ldquo;But poverty, if I have
the slightest knowledge of your character,
you could not bear. It would be the
bitterest punishment with which you could
be visited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can almost imagine,&rdquo; she said, with a
keen glance at me, &ldquo;that you have been
taking a lesson out of your son&rsquo;s book. You
tell me you have not seen him. Is it the
truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the truth. I am dealing plainly and
honestly with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a true Christian,&rdquo; she said, with
a sneer; &ldquo;good for evil&mdash;and such good for
such evil! Yet there is something unchristianlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in your threat, too. You would
thrust me into the streets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you made me thrust my son. As
heaven is my judge, I would do it, in the
cause of justice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is one side of your mind; there is
another. Suppose I plead guilty; suppose I
fall upon my knees before you and confess
my sin. My sin! My sins! For they are so
many&mdash;O, so many!&rdquo; She said this with a
theatrical air, and then spoke in a soberer
tone. &ldquo;That is a proper mode of confession
for such a woman as you believe me to be.
But without trying to impose upon you,
suppose I admit, without any attempt at romance
or deceit&mdash;for those acts are played
out now, are they not? and we come to a
winding-up of the plot&mdash;suppose I am wicked,
and guilty of every charge you bring against
me. What would you require me to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First to leave my house, taking with you
all that belongs to you&mdash;your trinkets,
dresses, and ornaments&mdash;to leave my house,
and never enter it again as long as you live.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I died, I might haunt you,&rdquo; she
said, with a laugh, &ldquo;though I assure you I
have no intention of dying for a good many
years yet. And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To renounce my name&mdash;adopt any other
you please, it matters not to me, but mine
you shall no longer bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the similarity between
your conditions and those of your son
is very wonderful. It is hardly possible to
believe you have not been conspiring&mdash;but of
course it would not become me to doubt the
word of so honourable a gentleman. And
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To leave the country for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another coincidence. I was almost inclined
myself to suggest it to you. And in
payment of these sacrifices, what do you
offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An income of twelve hundred pounds a
year, secured, to be paid regularly and faithfully
to you so long as you do not violate
the conditions of the agreement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secured by deed?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the manner most agreeable to
you. Do you consent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;In a moment!
No, indeed, I must have time to ponder, to
let the facts sink into my mind, as you said.
It is not only <em>your</em> life, <em>your</em> honour, and <em>your</em>
welfare that are concerned. It affects me
more than it does you, for I am young, and
have a long life before me; you are old, and
will soon be in your grave. I hope you have
no intention of cheating the law, and marrying
again. I can stand a great deal, but not
that. I am a jealous woman, and really loved
you for a few days. You loved me, too, or
you lied to me most wickedly. Is there any
other woman you wish to serve as you have
served me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were free, I should never marry
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, in her lightest tone,
&ldquo;it is a wise resolve. Only the young
should marry. When I am as old as you I
shall enter a convent, and repent, and become
good. Till then, I must continue to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wicked. How long do you give me to decide
between the two things you have offered
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time do you require?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day is Wednesday. Two days&mdash;that
will be Friday. But Friday is such an unlucky
day, and I am so unfortunate! On
Saturday&mdash;shall it be Saturday? Will you
give me till then? Have pity on me! You
will not refuse me so short a time as three
days, in which I am to decide my fate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words, written down, bear an entirely
different construction from that in which she
employed them. Her voice was a voice of
mockery, and upon her lips was the same
pleasant smile with which, I have no doubt,
she would have killed me where I stood had
it been in her power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be Saturday,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come then,&rdquo; she said sweetly, &ldquo;and
see once more the gentleman I swore to love,
honour, and obey. Thank you, so much!
Will you not kiss me, even now? Will you
not as much as shake hands with me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Cruel! If I had known you better, when
you begged me to be your wife, I should
have hesitated; I should not have trusted my
future to the hands of such a man. I had
my doubts; I said, &lsquo;He is too old, he cannot
understand a young heart like mine.&rsquo; Ah, if
I had listened to the voice of prudence! But
when was a woman in love prudent? I may
arrange my hair at your looking glass, may I
not? I am your wife, although you hate
me. Thank you once more. What a pretty
glass&mdash;and what a sweet room! I could live
here with you for ever, if you loved and
cared to have me. But it can never be, can
it? You have found me out. O, how
dreadful it is to be found out! Worse for a
woman than for a man&mdash;a thousand, thousand
times worse! My hair has grown
longer since I last saw you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think
so? And thicker. Feel it. No? How
miserable you are! Did you ever really love
me, I wonder? If I were a man, and loved a
woman as pretty as I am&mdash;you can&rsquo;t deny
that I <em>am</em> pretty; when I walk through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
streets with my veil up, nine men out of ten
stop and turn to look at me; that&rsquo;s why I
wear my veil down. A married woman!
They should be ashamed of themselves. But
what can a pretty woman do? What was I
saying? O, I remember. If I were a man,
and loved a woman as good-looking as I am,
I would go through fire and water for her. I
would, indeed! What a woman wants is
love, devotion&mdash;perfect devotion&mdash;and liberty
to do whatever she likes. That is all. Else
what does a woman marry for? To be a
slave? You say you will never marry again.
Nor will I&mdash;you shall not outdo me in
generosity. I may love, but I will never
marry&mdash;never, never! You men are either
fools or something worse&mdash;and women, too,
are fools when they sell themselves for
money, as I did, and tie themselves to
creatures who can&rsquo;t appreciate them. I don&rsquo;t
mean you, my dear. No&mdash;you are too soft,
and yielding, and honourable. More women
would be happy if there were more men in
the world like you. See how happy you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have made me&mdash;see what you have brought
me to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank upon a chair, and covered her
face with her hands, and I saw tears stealing
between her fingers&mdash;but I saw, also, that she
was watching my face all the while to note
the effect her words had upon me. I did not
interrupt her in her speech. I stood quietly
observing her, and wondering within myself
whether there were many women like her,
and whether other men were suffering as I
was suffering. All the while she was talking
she was arranging her hair, and displaying it
to the best advantage. Heaven knows how
old she is, but as she stood before me,
turning occasionally, looking at me through
the masses of fair hair which fell around her
face, she did not appear to be more than
eighteen. Her beauty, her appeals, the
tender modulations of her voice, produced no
other effect upon me than that of wonder and
disgust. I did not allow this feeling to be
seen; the stake at issue was too momentous
for me, by a sign, to jeopardise the end I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
working for. Presently she rose, and completed
the arrangements of her hair, which
she had purposely prolonged. Then, before
putting on her hat and cloak, she asked me
for a glass of wine. I had none, and I gave
her a glass of water; she tasted it, and threw
the rest away, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you should drink wine. It is
good for old men; it is nourishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still I did not speak, and as if to compel
me, she asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they not know your name in this
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you intend them to know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend them not to know it. You can,
of course, frustrate my intention if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish. I thought you desired to
keep it secret, and therefore, when I knocked
at the door and it was opened, I did not ask
for you by name, I simply asked if a gentleman
was in who had taken a lodging here
yesterday. The servant answered that he
was, and directed me to your room. She did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not even see my face. You see how I am
endeavouring to fall in with all your wishes&mdash;anticipating
them, even. But I love a
mystery dearly. Good day, my dear. Till
Saturday. I will be here, punctually at
twelve. Shall I kiss baby for you? No?
You are incorrigible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with nods and pleasant smiles she left
me, pulling her veil close over her face.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">MR. HOLDFAST&rsquo;S DIARY.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Thursday</span>, <i>3rd July</i>.&mdash;No news of my
son. I see by this morning&rsquo;s papers
that another vessel has arrived at Liverpool
from New York. It left four days after
the &ldquo;Germanic,&rdquo; so that, up to that time,
Frederick could not have called at the hotel
for the letter and money waiting there for
him. I am growing seriously uneasy. He
could not have mistaken my desire for a reconciliation.
What can have become of him?
He was in poor circumstances. Was he absolutely
in want? If he is dead, his death
lies at my door. A heavy lot is mine. I
shall never again know peace of mind until I
and Frederick clasp hands once more in love
and friendship.</p>

<p>Perhaps the secret enemy in New York who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
worked against me&mdash;watching my movements
and in some mysterious way becoming acquainted
with every step I took&mdash;was working
also against my son, watching him and misdirecting
him, as I was misdirected. It is
not an unlikely supposition. As I was sent
in one direction in search of him, he may have
been sent in another in search of me. Thus
have we been kept apart from each other. It
is certain that, shortly after he called at my
hotel, he must have left New York. My hope
is, that nothing worse than poverty has befallen
him. I am appalled at the thought
that he may have been made to disappear,
and may never more be heard of. It has
been the fate of many a poor fellow in that
fevered city. I pray to God that my fears
may not prove true.</p>

<p>The people in this house are very quiet.
They do not appear to entertain the slightest
curiosity concerning me. I walk in and out
as few times as possible, and I have not met
one of the lodgers face to face. A man might
live here for years in perfect obscurity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
die and be buried without being recognised,
if he pleased. There is no lonelier city in
the world than London.</p>

<p>What is my wife doing? Taking counsel
of her accomplice, Pelham, and debating with
him whether she shall accept the terms I have
offered her. She <em>must</em> accept them; she has
no alternative but the alternative of poverty
and exposure. A life of pleasure is before
her; it is all she lives for, and the income she
will receive from me will secure it. But
should she refuse? No, she will not refuse.
With such a cool, calculating villain as Pelham
to counsel her, the risk of a public exposure
is small.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Friday, 4th July.</i>&mdash;The quietest of days.
Since Wednesday I have not exchanged a
word with a human being. No one takes the
slightest notice of me as I walk in and out.
Still no news of my son. To-morrow my wife
will be here, and there will be an end to my
state of inaction.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Saturday, 5th July.</i>&mdash;The second interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with my wife has terminated. She could
have had no intention of putting me on my
guard, but she has done so, and on Monday I
shall take a step which will prevent injustice
being done to my son, in case he is alive.</p>

<p>My wife came into my room, as on the last
occasion, closely veiled, and with spirits as
animated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; she said, removing her hat and
cloak, and throwing them on the bed, &ldquo;not a
soul saw me. The servant girl, with her face
as black as coal, opened the door, and asked
what I wanted. &lsquo;The gentleman on the first
floor,&rsquo; I said, and pushed past her. And do
you know I took the precaution to disguise
my voice. She wouldn&rsquo;t recognise me if she
heard me speak in my natural voice. I did
this for your sake, my dear&mdash;you are so
anxious for secrecy. Am I not considerate?
I don&rsquo;t mind being seen and known, for I have
nothing to conceal, but I must obey you.
And how have you been all this time? Well,
I hope. How foolish you are to remain
cooped up in this miserable house when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
have a comfortable home waiting for you! I
have expected you&mdash;upon my word I have;
and your room is ready for you, with a nice
fire always burning, and your slippers, placed
right and left, just by your arm-chair. O, I
know what a wife&rsquo;s duty is. Let me prevail
upon you. Come home with me now. I will
not reproach you&mdash;indeed I will not. I will
be just as faithful and loving as I have ever
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused for my answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wasting time,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
know well that I shall never again enter my
house while you are there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, tapping my arm lightly
with a pearl fan I had given her, &ldquo;you cannot
entirely deceive me. I have been thinking a
great deal. It is my belief you are a
Don Juan. I had my suspicions when
you first made love to me&mdash;an old gentleman
like you falling in love with a girl
like me, because I have a pretty face, and
bright eyes, and a lovely mouth. You were
fond of kissing it once&mdash;O, you men, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
men! Will artless women ever be a match
for you? I am afraid never, you speak so
softly, and promise so much. Yes, I have been
thinking a great deal, and I know all about it
now. I know why you have been absent so
long; I know why you come unexpectedly to
London, and hide yourself as you are doing;
I know why you will not enter your house
while I am there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused again, and half sullenly, half
gaily, gave me to understand that she expected
me to challenge her knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no interest to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but it
may bring us nearer to our real business
if I ask you for information on these points.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, with an impudent laugh,
&ldquo;there is another lady in the case, of course,
who is to step into my shoes. It is useless
denying it. Old men are not to be trusted.
Come, my dear, make a clean breast of it. I
won&rsquo;t scold you more than I can help. It is
quite natural, though. I have my feelings as
a woman, and I warn your new fancy to keep
out of my path. You must have been a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
rake when you were young&mdash;almost as bad
as your son, who made love to me in the most
shameful manner; to me, his second mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I scorned to pursue the subject. Wilful,
wicked, sinful and cunning, as she was, I felt
that to a certain extent it would be as well to
let her have her way with her tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have fully relieved your mind,&rdquo;
I said coldly, &ldquo;I am ready to enter into the
business matter which brings us together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she had not yet done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Business&mdash;business&mdash;business!
How often are you going to use
that word? Is love a business, then? You
can tell me, for you must have had hundreds
of sad adventures. I have had very few as
yet, but there is time for plenty more. My
dear, I positively refuse to enter into our
special little affair until you assure me there
is no other lady in the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Compelled to reply, I said, &ldquo;There is
none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She mocked me with a deep sigh, saying,
&ldquo;You have taken a weight off my heart,&rdquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
then in a brisk tone, &ldquo;And now, my dear,
we will go into matters.&rdquo; She drew her chair
close to the table, and produced a dainty little
pocket-book, in which she consulted some
slips of paper, a few of them covered with
figures. &ldquo;You offer me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;twelve
hundred pounds a year, upon conditions
which will cover me with disgrace,
and make people point at me. Is that
correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You have omitted
that you are to live out of England in any
name you choose except the name of Holdfast.
Your new acquaintances will know
nothing of your past life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a miracle if it is hidden from
them,&rdquo; she said, betraying a method in her
speech which proved that she had carefully
rehearsed what she came prepared to say.
&ldquo;I do not intend to live in a desert. If I am
driven by your cruelty from the country I
love, and where, with money, a lady may enjoy
all the pleasures of life, I shall live on the
Continent, in France, Italy, Germany, where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
please, but certainly where I can best enjoy
myself. English people travel everywhere,
and I shall be sure to drop across old acquaintances,
or, at least, people who know me at
sight. My face is too pretty to be forgotten.
Perhaps you will admit that I cannot lose myself
entirely, and that Lydia Holdfast, by
whatever name she goes, will always be Lydia
Holdfast in the eyes of casual or close acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not relate my troubles to any one,&rdquo;
I observed, as yet ignorant of her intention
in adopting this line of argument, &ldquo;nor need
you, if you choose to preserve silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not already spoken of what
has occurred?&rdquo; she asked, with a keen glance
at me. &ldquo;Have you not already selected confidants
to whom you have poured out false
stories of your wrongs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man or woman in the world possesses
my confidence. My griefs are sacred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How poetical! But although we shall
not talk, other people will. Men and women
are so charitable! They don&rsquo;t like scandal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and it hurts them so much to rob even the
most innocent woman of her character! No,
no, my love; I know the world better than to
believe that. Not that I have ever taken
away a character, man or woman&rsquo;s, but then
everybody is not like me, artless, and simple,
and inexperienced!&rdquo; (No words of mine can
convey an idea of the impudent manner in
which she thus lauded herself, knowing the
while and knowing that I knew, that she was
speaking in mockery. If she desired to
irritate me by this exhibition of effrontery,
she failed. I preserved my composure
throughout the entire scene. She continued:)
&ldquo;So, my character would be completely
taken away, and ladies with whom I should
wish to be on friendly terms would turn their
backs upon me. I should be thrown into the
company of women who would not be admitted
into a decent house, and of men
whose only aim would be to pass their time
agreeably and play upon my feelings. My
dear, I am fond of good society; I doat upon
it; and it breaks my heart to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
respectability would shrug its respectable
shoulders at me. It is right that I should
put it plainly to you, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you have more to say,
and have come prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am prepared, you see. I am
obliged to consult my notes, my poor little
head is so weak. You remember how I used
to suffer with it, and how often you bathed it
for me. Gold would not have been too good
for me to eat then, would it? A look
would bring you at my feet; you could not
do enough for me; and now, I daresay, you
would like to give me a dose of poison.
What courage I must have to shut myself in
here with you alone, where nobody knows
either of us, and where you might murder
me, and run away without fear of discovery!
It is the courage of innocence, my dear.
Where did I leave off just now? O, about
my being deprived of respectable society, and
thrust into the company of blackguards.
And for this, and for giving up my beautiful
home and position and forfeiting my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
name, you offer me twelve hundred pounds a
year. And you, worth millions!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake. My business is broken up,
and I am not so rich as you suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a miser, my dear. You are
worth at least ten thousand a year. I do not
forget what you told me when you honoured
me with your love and confidence. At least
ten thousand, and I am to accept twelve
hundred. My darling husband, it is not
enough. Wherever I live I shall require an
establishment. I have your daughter to
bring up&mdash;the darlingest little thing you ever
saw! You shall not see her now if I can
prevent it&mdash;casting shame upon her, as you
have done, before she has learnt to say
Mama! I will do my duty by her&mdash;a
mother&rsquo;s duty, and a father&rsquo;s duty as well,
and I will bring her up to hate you. If you
live long enough you shall be made to feel it.
And now, when she cannot speak for herself,
I am to stand like a tame cat, and see her
robbed! She is to be made a beggar. Such
a beautiful girl as she will have to go in rags,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
because the father who disowns her is a mean,
stingy monster. I hope I do not offend you,
my dear, but the truth is the truth, and had
best be spoken. Yes, she will be beautiful&mdash;but
beauty and beggary&mdash;&mdash; Well, we know
what becomes of that partnership. She shall
not be compelled to sell herself, as I did, to
an old money-bag, with no heart, and you
shall not cheat her and me of what is due to
us. No, my dear, I stand up for my child,
as every mother should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in as few words as
possible, what it is you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall use,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;as many words as
I please. You would like to rob me of my
tongue as well as of my rights. What is it I
want? An establishment&mdash;money to provide
a suitable home for your discarded child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three thousand pounds&mdash;not less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have it; in addition to the
annuity I have offered you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How generous you are! What a pity
you were not a young man when you met me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
first! We might really have got on very
well together for a few years, until you were
tired of me or I was of you. Three thousand
pounds will be little enough to furnish with,
but I must manage. Then there&rsquo;s the house;
and living abroad is so expensive. It is like
going into exile&mdash;the same as those dear
French refugees. It will cost at least three
thousand a year; I can&rsquo;t see how it is to be
done for less. And to wait every quarter for
the cheque to pay servants, and butchers, and
bakers, and dressmakers. No, my dear, it
would be too harassing&mdash;it would be the
death of me. So I have consulted a friend&mdash;a
lady friend&mdash;you don&rsquo;t believe me? You
think it&rsquo;s a gentleman friend. Well, my dear,
I shall not quarrel with you on that point.
Say a gentleman friend, then; I&rsquo;m not particular.
He has advised me not to place any
dependence on a man who has treated me as
you have done. He is right. I will not place
dependence on you. I will not take
your word, and I will not be satisfied with a
paper drawn up by a lawyer of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
choosing. Lawyers are rogues; they will do
anything for money, and you are rich enough
to buy them. No, my darling husband, it
must be a sum of money down, and then we
will say good bye, and agree never to kiss
and be friends. It would be as if we had
never known each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Desirous to ascertain how far her cupidity
had led her, or rather the extent of the demand
her associate Pelham had instructed her
to make, I pressed her to be quite explicit.
With some show of timidity&mdash;for the stake
she was playing for was enormous&mdash;she wrote
upon a leaf in her pocket-book the sum for
which she would agree to release me. It was
fifty thousand pounds. I tore the leaf in two
and threw it into the fireplace, with the simple
word, &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why impossible?&rdquo; she asked, biting her
lips, with a wicked look at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more than half my fortune,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am entitled to more than half,&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;I shall have your child to educate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and provide for, and a woman&rsquo;s expenses are
larger than a man&rsquo;s. Dress, amusements,
nurses, governesses&mdash;there are a thousand
things to pay for which you would never
dream of. What I ask for is really moderate.
You are lucky you have not to deal with some
women; they would not let you off so easily.
Let me persuade you, my dear. Put an end
to all this worry, give me a cheque, and let
us say good-bye to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall put an end to it, if you compel
me,&rdquo; I said, firmly, &ldquo;in the manner I have
determined upon, in the event of your refusal
to listen to reason. In right and justice you
are not entitled to a shilling; your shameful
life should properly meet its just punishment,
and would, at the hands of a man less weak&mdash;I
will not say less merciful&mdash;than I. The terms
I have offered you are foolishly liberal, but I
will adhere to them, and am ready to bind
myself to them, unless you drive me to another
course. I will give you the three thousand
pounds you ask for to set up and furnish a
house, and I shall require proof that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
money is so expended. But as for any other
large sum of money down, as you express it,
in lieu of the annuity I offer you, or any
increase of that annuity, receive from me the
distinct assurance that under no possible circumstances
shall I consent to it. If I could
find plainer and stronger words to impress
this upon you, I would do so, but I think you
understand me. The friend who is advising
you is advising you to your injury, and is
mistaken in me. There is a point beyond
which it is dangerous to drive me, and if I
once turn, you will find yourself a beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are growing bold, my love,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken again,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I
were bold, I should order you immediately
from this room. If I were bold, I should set
the lawyers at work without an hour&rsquo;s delay.
But recrimination is useless, and can lead to
no good result. Why do you conduct yourself
like an actress when we two are alone,
and there are no witnesses to be misled or
deceived? We know each other. No argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
could convince you that I am anything
but a weak, old man, who in an unhappy
moment entrusted his honour to one who
brought shame and misery to his heart and
home, or could convince me that you are a
good and virtuous woman. Why, then, should
we prolong this interview? I made you a
most generous offer. You asked me for three
days to consider it, and now you come, and
for some purpose&mdash;not a wise one, I judge&mdash;introduce
propositions to which you can
never induce me to agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fighting for my rights,&rdquo; she said
sullenly, and I knew that I had made an impression
upon her. &ldquo;You have ruined my
life; I might have married a richer man than
you. Why did you spoil my chances? It
would be a million times better for me if you
were dead, for then your property would all
be mine, instead of the miserable allowance
you offer me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She suddenly paused, conscious that she
had made a mistake. It is likely that she
was apprised of her error by an expression in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
my face produced by her words, for it is a
fact that up to this moment I had forgotten
that I had made a Will by which everything
I possessed was left to her, solely and unconditionally.
I had made this Will in haste,
after I had broken with my son, who at that
time was my heir. It was a proof of my confidence
in the woman who betrayed me&mdash;one
of those foolish acts of which angry men are
often guilty, done in haste, to be repented of
in leisure unless timefully atoned for. Thank
God there is time to repair this error!</p>

<p>I gave no expression to my thoughts; it
was necessary to be careful in the presence of
such a woman as my wife. But so anxious
was she to assure herself of the exact position
in which she stood that she over-reached herself
in her cunning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you made another Will?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;There is time before
me; I am not yet quite broken-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She breathed more freely, and said meekly,
&ldquo;Yes, there is time before you in which you
can dispossess me and my child. When this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
dreadful dispute is over, I shall have no
further claim upon you. Are you really
determined not to be a little more generous
to me? Will you not give me fifteen hundred
a year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not to be deceived by her mock
humility; heaven only knows what was
hidden beneath it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not to be moved,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and there
must be an end at once to prevarication.
Your answer must be &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; or &lsquo;no,&rsquo; and it
must be given quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If not to-day, at least within the next
three or four days,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I will no
longer be kept in a state of suspense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me with a sad expression,
which might have deceived another man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at two
o&rsquo;clock, I will give you my final answer. It
must be &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; of course, for you are strong
and I am weak, but I will wait till then. I
am bound to consult my friend before I
commit myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>All her gaiety appeared to have deserted
her. In silence she put on her hat and shawl,
and bade me good morning, saying she would
come at two o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday.</p>

<p>I mistrust her; I will delay no longer. On
Monday I will draw out another Will, making
my son my heir, and in case of his not being
alive&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;leaving my money
to charitable purposes.</p>

<p>It is a relief to reflect that my anxiety regarding
my wife will soon be at an end. She
cannot but consent to my proposal, and then
I shall be free from her for ever. Would to
God I had never seen her!</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Sunday, 6th July.</i>&mdash;This has been truly a
Sabbath Day, a day of prayer, to me, and has
been passed in contemplation of my past life,
and in supplications for the future. If a man
could but see the consequences of his errors
before he was committed to them, how much
misery to himself, how much injustice to
others, would be avoided! It is almost incredible
that, blessed in the memory of a wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
with a pure heart and mind, I should have
been led into a second marriage with such a
woman as Lydia Wilson. The fault was
more mine than hers. She had led a life of
shame and duplicity, and it was not to be
expected that the simple forming of an acquaintanceship
with me would change her
character. I should have been wiser, or at
least more prudent. I ought certainly to have
made an inquiry into the truth or falsehood
of the story she told me, or I might have
considered that the union of a man of my age
with a woman of hers could not be a happy
one. It is too late now to repent of an act
which has brought its own just and bitter
punishment. The only reparation I can make
is to endeavour to repair the evil consequences
which have ensued. The one aim of
my life, after the settlement with my wife is
accomplished, will be to find my son. I
will advertise for him in the English and
American newspapers, and this surely will
bring me news of him. But it may not be
necessary; he may be with me any time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
this week. If a father&rsquo;s prayers could bring
him to my side he would be here at this
moment.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Monday, 7th July.</i>&mdash;I have been employed
during a great part of the day in preparing
and writing a new Will. Not wishing to
consult a lawyer and so to make known my
presence in London, and fearful also of delay,
I purchased at a stationer&rsquo;s shop, at some
distance from Great Porter Square, printed
forms of Wills from which I drew out a
testamentary disposition of my property.
This task occupied me until four o&rsquo;clock in
the afternoon, and the next task was to
obtain witnesses to my signature. These
could have been obtained in the house, but
if I had attempted it I should have destroyed
my incognito. I went to the shop of the
stationer of whom I purchased the printed
forms, and I returned them to him, and
made some small purchases, to the amount
of a couple of sovereigns. I then asked the
shopkeeper whether he would have any objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to witnessing my signature to a Will,
and to allowing an assistant who was serving
in the shop also to witness it. He consented,
and I signed without giving him a
clear opportunity of distinguishing my name;
the names of the witnesses followed, and the
Will was complete. In payment of the service
rendered to me I left in the man&rsquo;s
shop the goods I had bought and paid for;
I had no use for them.</p>

<p>The Will is before me now, and I have
read it carefully over. Everything appears
to be stated in proper legal form, and I have
no doubt that it sets my last Will completely
aside. What I have done myself
without the aid of lawyers has been simply
a measure of precaution for the next few
days. Wednesday, I hope, will be the last
day of my enforced retirement.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Wednesday, 8th July.</i>&mdash;It is now four
o&rsquo;clock. My wife entered my room at one
o&rsquo;clock, an hour before that appointed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
our meeting. I did not hear her step on
the stairs or in the passage, and not expecting
her I was looking over the Will I made
yesterday and the pages of the diary I have
kept since I became a lodger in this house.
As she entered, suddenly and unexpectedly,
I threw a newspaper over my writing, not
wishing to excite her suspicions or to arouse
her curiosity; but, as I soon discovered, I
was not successful. She was in her usual
gay mood, and came in with smiles and bright
looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here I am,
punctual to the minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an hour too early,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;our appointment was for two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo;clock, my dear,&rdquo; she said, correcting
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is immaterial,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and if it
bring our business to a speedier conclusion,
the mistake of an hour will be agreeable to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded pleasantly, and, as in our previous
interviews, took off her hat and mantle,
and placed them aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been busy,&rdquo; she said, pointing
to the newspaper which covered my papers.
&ldquo;Are you writing a book?&rdquo; I did not
answer her, and she continued, still preserving
her light tone. &ldquo;Make me your
heroine, my love, but do not be too hard to
me. Say something good of me if you can.
You may say that, after all, I showed my good
sense, and agreed to your proposals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to accept this as an acquiescence in
the arrangement I have proposed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; I have grown sensible. I
give in to all your terms. I will go away
from England, and will never, never return.
I will give up the name of Holdfast; I will
even forget the name of Lydia, and will go
out into the world a new woman. A better
one, I hope. There is but one thing I insist
upon. Now that I have made up my mind,
and that nothing can alter it&mdash;nothing, my
dear; I would not live with you again if you
were to entreat me on your knees&mdash;I want
this business matter settled at once, this very
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be done?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Draw up a paper
for me to sign, and another for you to sign.
I will take them away with me, and will show
them to my lawyer. Yes, my love, I have
consulted a lawyer, and he has advised me to
agree to all you propose. If he says the
papers are properly drawn out, I will come
again to-night, at ten o&rsquo;clock, and will bring
my lawyer with me, to see that they are
regularly signed. I will keep my agreement,
and you will keep yours, and to-morrow
morning I will leave your house, and you can
go home and take possession. Nobody but
ourselves will be the wiser, and your secret
and mine will never be known to the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no lawyer,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I do not know
whether I can draw up the agreement in legal
form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try, my love,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are fond
of writing, and have had great experience.
You can put anything you please in the
paper you wish me to sign. You can make
it, if you like, a confession from me that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
have been a faithless wife, and that my child
is not yours. I will sign it. That will suit
you, will it not? And it will give you such
a hold upon me that, if I break my word, you
can release yourself from me, without ever
paying me a shilling. That is fair, I am sure,
and afterwards, if you are not satisfied with the
agreements, your lawyer can draw up others
more binding on both of us. I am so sick of
you, my love, that nothing else will satisfy
me but an immediate break between us. Do
I not put myself entirely in your power? If
you refuse now, I shall leave you to take
any steps against me you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I considered a few moments, and then
consented. To go to law, to sue for a
divorce, was a matter of months. The plan
she proposed was all in my favour, and it
would leave me free to recommence immediately
the search for my son. I would
draw up such a paper as would bind her
beyond hope of appeal, and all danger of
publicity would be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your lawyer?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>She produced a letter from a lawyer in
Buckingham Palace Road replying to certain
points she had submitted to him. I was
satisfied, and said that I would endeavour
to draw up the agreements.</p>

<p>It was a work of time&mdash;of quite two hours&mdash;and
while I was employed over the papers
she sat down before the piano in my room,
which I had never opened, and played the
sweetest melodies with which she was
familiar. She betrayed no impatience; only
once did she rise from the piano, and disarranged
the papers on the table, in pretended
search of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite an author,&rdquo; she remarked as her
eyes fell upon the pages of my diary, among
which was my new Will.</p>

<p>Nothing of greater importance occurred.
The agreements being ready, she read them
over slowly, and simply said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have protected yourself, my love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have stated the truth,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and
your signature will verify it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remained with me some short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
after this, making frivolous remarks, to which
I returned but brief answers. Then she left
me, on the understanding that she would come
to the house at ten o&rsquo;clock to sign the papers,
which she took with her.</p>

<p>On reflection, I think it will be wise even
now to be on my guard against her. She
saw the pages of my diary, and might have
seen the Will. I will put them out of
her reach. The room next to this is empty,
and the door is unlocked. I will go and see
if I can secrete them there....
There is in that room, in an old-fashioned
table, an empty drawer which might easily
escape observation. There is a small key in
the lock. I will deposit these pages at once
in the drawer, where they will be safe for a
few hours.</p>

<p>My long agony is approaching its end.
Impatiently I wait for the night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">CAGED.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">With</span> those words the diary ended.</p>

<p>In breathless silence, oblivious for
the time of every surrounding circumstance,
Frederick Holdfast perused the record of his
father&rsquo;s last hours. What followed, after his
father had secreted the papers, was clear to
his mind. Mrs. Holdfast had kept her appointment
at ten o&rsquo;clock, accompanied by her
&ldquo;lawyer,&rdquo; who could have been no other
than the villain Pelham. By a hapless
fatality, the house, No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter
Square, had on that night but one inmate&mdash;the
man who was never to see another rising
sun. The landlady and her lodgers were at
a wedding feast; the servant was enjoying the
glories of the Alhambra, in the company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
her sweetheart. Only Mr. Holdfast remained,
and thus his murderers were enabled
to enter and leave the house without being
observed. Most likely he himself opened the
street door for them. In the privacy of his
room, with no witnesses near, the mask was
thrown off by Mrs. Holdfast and her associate,
and demands were made upon Mr. Holdfast
with which he refused to comply. Whether
the purpose of his visitors was murder
would never now be known, but murder was
accomplished before they departed, and the
unhappy man was left by the wretched pair
in the agonies of death. It was necessary,
thereafter, for their own safety that they
should not be seen in the neighbourhood of
Great Porter Square, and it would have
excited suspicion had they exhibited the
slightest interest in the mysterious murder
of a man whose body had not been identified.
Before leaving their victim they had taken
the precaution to empty his pockets of papers,
and to remove from the room everything in
writing which might have led to the identification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the body. Having made themselves
safe, they left the house, and kept out of sight.
But some time afterwards Mrs. Holdfast
must have recalled, in conversation with
Pelham, the memory of the sheets of paper
covered with her husband&rsquo;s writing which
she had seen upon the table when she had
visited him; these pages were not found in
his room, and they were then tormented
by the idea that the writing was still in existence,
and might one day be discovered to
criminate and bring their guilt home to them.
It became, therefore, vital to their safety that
the papers should not fall into other hands,
and for the purpose of searching for them
and obtaining possession of them, Pelham
had disguised himself as Richard Manx, and
had taken an attic in No.&nbsp;118 Great Porter
Square, from which room he could gain easy
access to the house in which the murder had
been committed.</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence of guilt was
complete, but direct evidence, in his father&rsquo;s
own writing, now lay in Frederick Holdfast&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hands. What remained to be done was to
bring the murderer to the bar of justice.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost. It was now
late in the night, and Pelham was doubtless
upstairs, busily engaged in his last search.</p>

<p>Frederick placed the papers carefully in his
breast pocket. His honour was established, his
name was returned to him, he was absolved
from his oath. He could resume his position
in the world, and could offer to the woman
he loved an honourable position in society.
It was she who had led him to this discovery;
had it not been for her courage, the wretches
would have escaped, and his father&rsquo;s murder
remained unavenged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; said Frederick, &ldquo;will deliver
the murderer into the hands of justice. Tonight
he shall sleep in a felon&rsquo;s cell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had no fear. Single-handed he would
arrest Pelham; it was but man to man, and
he was armed, and his cause was just.</p>

<p>He listened for a moment. It was a wild
night, and the rain was pouring down heavily.
The detective and his assistants were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Square, waiting upon his summons. Nothing
but the plashing of the rain was to be heard;
no other sound fell upon his ears from within
or without. The murderer was working
warily in the room above; he himself would
be as wary. Cunning for cunning, silence for
silence, a life for a life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You murderous villain!&rdquo; murmured
Frederick. &ldquo;Were it not that I dare not
stain my soul with a crime, you should not
live another hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his stocking-feet he crept from the
kitchen, and stepped noiselessly up-stairs.
In his hushed movements was typified the
retribution which waits upon the man who
sheds the blood of a human being.</p>

<p>As he ascended the stairs which led to the
first floor he was made aware, by the sound
of a man moving softly in the room in which
his father had been murdered, that Pelham
was at work. In a few moments Frederick
Holdfast was at the door, listening.</p>

<p>Before he turned the handle, he looked
through the key-hole to mark the exact spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
upon which Pelham stood, so that he might
seize him the instant he entered the room.
To his surprise he saw two persons in the
room&mdash;Pelham bending over the floor boards
he had torn up, and the form of a man lying
on the bed.</p>

<p>He could not see the face of the recumbent
man; the face of Pelham was clearly visible.</p>

<p>It was not, then, man to man. There were
two to one. Justice might be defeated were
he to risk the unequal encounter. He determined
to call in the assistance of the
officers in the Square.</p>

<p>But before he left the house, which was
being watched from the front and the back,
it would be as well to make sure of the
murderer and his companion, so that they
should have no possible means of escape. He
took from his pocket the key of the room,
which he had picked up a few hours ago;
with a steady hand he inserted it in the lock,
and gently turned it, being unable to prevent
the sound of a slight click. Then he crept
noiselessly down stairs, opened the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
door, closed it softly behind him, and stepping
into the road, put a whistle to his lips.</p>

<p>The summons was not instantly obeyed,
and he blew the whistle again, and looked
anxiously around. The faint sound of another
whistle presently answered him, and in two
or three minutes the detective was by his
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at the back of the house, sir,&rdquo; said
the detective, in apology, &ldquo;giving directions
to one of my men, Parrock, a sharp fellow.
You have discovered something,&rdquo; he added,
noting Frederick&rsquo;s agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found my father&rsquo;s diary,&rdquo; said
Frederick, speaking rapidly, &ldquo;and a Will he
made two or three days before he was
murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Making you all right, I hope,&rdquo; said the
detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but that is of no consequence. The
diary, which I have read, leaves no room to
doubt that my father was murdered by his
wife&rsquo;s accomplice, Pelham. The evidence is
conclusive, and he cannot escape the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
once we have him safe. He must be arrested
this moment. He is in my father&rsquo;s room. I
would have secured him myself, but he has
another man with him, and I did not care to
run the chance of two against one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has a woman with him, you mean,&rdquo;
said the detective, &ldquo;not a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man, I mean,&rdquo; replied Frederick; &ldquo;I
saw him with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, with <em>my</em> own eyes,&rdquo; rejoined the
detective, &ldquo;saw Mrs. Holdfast enter No.&nbsp;118
this evening, in company of Richard Manx,
otherwise Pelham. Attend to me a moment,
sir. I see through it all. Mrs. Holdfast accompanied
him to-night into the house. Never
mind the motive&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s motive, say&mdash;curiosity,
wilfulness, anything will serve.
Pelham does not want her company&mdash;she
forces it on him. What does he do then?
He dresses her in a suit of his clothes, so that
they may not attract attention when they
leave Great Porter Square to-night for good.
She is a noticeable woman, sir, and has a style
about her which one can&rsquo;t help remarking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
The person you saw was Mrs. Holdfast, dressed
in man&rsquo;s clothes. They are both, you say, in
the room your father occupied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have locked them in, so that
they cannot easily get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they hear the key turn?&rdquo; asked the
detective, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very quiet, and I think they did
not hear the movement. If you are right in
your conjecture, they have thrown themselves
into our hands; their being together in that
room is an additional proof of their guilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. They are trapped. What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; cried the detective, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Frederick, following the
detective&rsquo;s startled glance, which was directed
towards the first-floor window of No.&nbsp;119.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A flash! There! Another! Do you see
it? By God, sir! they have set fire to the
house! Ah, here is Parrock,&rdquo; he said, turning
to the man who had run quickly to his
side. &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is on fire,&rdquo; said the man, who
was out of breath with fast running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Any fool can see that. Get to the back
of the house instantly. Take another man
with you, and arrest every person who attempts
to escape.&rdquo; Parrock disappeared. By
this time the flames were rushing out of the
front window of the first floor. &ldquo;Fire!
Fire!&rdquo; cried the detective. &ldquo;The neighbourhood
is roused already. Stand close by
the street door, sir, and don&rsquo;t let Pelham slip
you. He has set fire to the house, and hopes
to escape in the confusion. Leave all the
rest to me. There is the door of 118 opening,
and there is your young lady, sir, safe and
sound. I wish you joy. Waste as little time
as possible on her. Your first thought must
be for your father&rsquo;s murderers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Frederick passed to the street door of
119 he caught Blanche&rsquo;s hand, and she accompanied
him. He stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, you are safe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our
troubles are over. I have found my father&rsquo;s
Will and diary. Pelham is the murderer; he
is in this house now&mdash;hunted down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Blanche, clinging to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
&ldquo;There is some one else in the house. That
is a woman&rsquo;s scream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a scream of terrible anguish, uttered
by a woman in a moment of supreme despair.
Every face turned white as that awful cry
floated from the burning building.</p>

<p class="sbt2">RETRIBUTION.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Frederick Holdfast turned the key
in the lock, Pelham raised his head,
and looked in alarm at Mrs. Holdfast. She,
also, hearing the sound, slightly raised herself
from the bed upon which she was reclining
and looked into Pelham&rsquo;s face. Dazed with
fear, they remained thus, transfixed, gazing
at each other, and did not speak for full a
minute. Then Pelham, with his finger on his
lips, looked upward to the ceiling, in the supposition
that the sound had proceeded from
above. For full another minute neither of
them moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything?&rdquo; asked Pelham,
in a whisper. &ldquo;Speak low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, trembling with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said the terrified woman.
&ldquo;You told me no person was in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor has there been,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nor is
there, I believe. But there may be rats. We
will give up the house to them. What are
you staring at, you fool?&rdquo; he cried, turning
swiftly round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a shadow moving behind
you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s gone. It was my fancy. Pelham,
I am frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you come here for? I advised
you to go home, but you had the devil in you,
and would have your way. Let us make an
end of this. In mischief&rsquo;s name, what&rsquo;s the
matter with you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she exclaimed, seizing his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he demanded roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard a whistle outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of that? Boys whistling in the
streets are common enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a boy whistling. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
shrill sound, as though some one was calling
men about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or calling a cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! there it is again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were the two whistles by which
Frederick summoned the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a boy whistling a tune,&rdquo; said
Pelham, &ldquo;nor a summons for a cab. I don&rsquo;t
suppose it concerns us, but you have succeeded
in putting a stop to my work. I&rsquo;ll do
no more. Your dead husband&rsquo;s Will, if he
made one, and anything else he wrote, will
soon be out of reach of living man. Now for
the finishing touches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He poured the spirit about the room, and
saturated some sheets of paper with it, placing
them beneath the boards in such a way as to
produce an effectual blaze the moment a light
was applied to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite an artist,&rdquo; he said, laughing.
&ldquo;In five minutes there will be a conflagration
which will spread too rapidly for a
fire engine to extinguish until everything on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
this floor at least is burnt to ashes. Grace,
old girl, this is a business that suits me; I was
never meant for milk-and-water work. The
house on fire, and we a mile away, and all
danger will be over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His gleeful tone jarred upon his guilty
associate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work in silence,&rdquo; she said, with a
shudder. &ldquo;Do you forget what was done in
this room the last time we were here
together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No, I shall
never forget. But it does not trouble me.
Every man for himself&mdash;it is nature&rsquo;s law,
and he is a fool who allows himself to be
trampled on and ruined, when he has the
opportunity of putting his enemy out of the
way. Well, it is done, and I am going to
reap. These last twelve months I have led
the life of a dog; now I&rsquo;ll live like a gentleman.
There! everything is ready. Now for
escape. Grace, you go first to the top of the
house, and wait for me. The moment I set
fire to this rubbish, I will join you. We will
get back into the next house, where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
will be plenty of people to help to save the
furniture; we will mix with them, and in the
confusion slip off. A kiss, Grace, for luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They kissed each other, and she went to
the door, and turned the handle, but could
not open the door. It was fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;We are
locked in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The full meaning of this flashed instantly
upon them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trapped!&rdquo; cried Pelham, savagely.</p>

<p>He knew well that the game was up, and
that nothing short of a miracle would save
him. The sound they had heard was the
clicking of the lock; the whistles they had
heard were a summons to their pursuers.
While they had deemed themselves safe,
enemies had been watching them. They
were caught in their own trap.</p>

<p>Pelham strove to force the door open, but
had not sufficient strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as weak as a rat,&rdquo; he muttered
hoarsely, &ldquo;but there is still a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tore the sheets from the bed, and in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
incredibly short space of time, working like a
madman, knotted them together. His design
was to escape from the house by the back
window, but he could find no hold for his
rope within the room. As he looked eagerly
around he felt himself seized by Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; she cried, hysterically. &ldquo;It
is there again&mdash;the Shadow of the man we
murdered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook her off, and in her terror, she
slipped back, and overturned the candlestick,
which was on the floor, with a lighted
candle in it. The light instantly communicated
itself to the spirit and inflammable
matter which Pelham had scattered about,
and the next moment the room was in a blaze.
Vainly did Pelham strive to beat out the fire.
Blinded by the smoke, and the flames which
presently enveloped them, they staggered
and stumbled in their tomb of fire, and then
it was that Grace gave utterance to the terrible
cry of anguish which drove the blood

surging in Great Porter Square.</p>

<p class="sbt2">IN WHICH THE &ldquo;EVENING MOON&rdquo; GIVES A
SEQUEL TO ITS &ldquo;ROMANCE IN REAL LIFE.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> have much pleasure (said the <cite>Evening
Moon</cite>, two days after the fire) in presenting
our readers with the last act of a
drama which, in plot, incident, and extraordinary
development of character, equals
anything in the way of sensationalism which
has ever graced theatrical boards. The
opportunity is an agreeable one to us, as it
enables us to do justice to a gentleman who
has had reason to complain of what has
appeared in our columns concerning him.
What we have to say resolves itself into
something more than the last act of a drama;
it is both that and the commencement of a
Sequel which, in all human probability, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
because of the nature of the persons engaged
in it, will have a happier ending than that
which has been closed by the burning down
of the house, No.&nbsp;119, Great Porter Square.</p>

<p>In our yesterday&rsquo;s issues we gave the full
particulars of that fire. No one was injured
except the two wretched beings who met
their just and awful fate in the grave they had
prepared for themselves. They have passed
away from this world, but it will be long
before the memory of their crime and its
involvements will be forgotten. It has been
determined to pull down the fatal house in
which the murder was committed, and to
rebuild it anew. The house next to it, No.&nbsp;118,
occupied by Mrs. Preedy, lodging-house
keeper, received some damage from the fire;
but Mrs. Preedy is fully insured, and her loss
will be a gain to her&mdash;a paradox, but strictly
accurate, for the murder in the adjoining
house had brought hers into disrepute, and
her business was languishing. It will revive
now that the fire has burnt out the terror of
the crime; and the worthy Mrs. Preedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
may congratulate herself upon having gained
friends in the persons of Mr. Frederick Holdfast
and the intrepid, noble-hearted lady who
will shortly bear his name.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s house lived an old bedridden
lady, Mrs. Bailey, whose life was with
some difficulty saved. She herself placed
serious obstacles in the way of her preservation,
screaming out when they attempted to
remove her from her bed. She clung to this
household god with such tenacity that there
was nothing for it but to humour the old lady,
and to remove it with her. As they carried
it down stairs, the covering was by an accident
ripped, and there rolled out of it between
thirty and forty sovereigns, which Mrs.
Bailey had hoarded up since the death of her
husband, an event which occurred Heaven
knows how many years ago. The distress of
the old lady was extreme, but the gold was
picked up and returned to its owner, minus
a few sovereigns, which somehow had
stuck to the fingers of the searchers. She is,
however, no loser by the accident, as Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Frederick Holdfast made good the deficiency.
It is satisfactory to learn that a cherished
tradition current in Great Porter Square, that
the old lady&rsquo;s mattress was stuffed with gold,
was verified by the ripping of the sacking.
Mrs. Bailey will no doubt find another safe
for her treasure in the future. The bedridden
old lady sustained a loss in the burning of a
linnet without a note to its voice, and a very
old bull-finch, whose cage hung at the foot
of her bed&mdash;a sacrifice of life, in addition to
the more terrible sacrifice of two human
beings, which we were almost forgetting to
mention.</p>

<p>In another part of our paper will be found
a full report of the proceedings at the inquest
upon the bodies of the man and woman,
which were found in the back room of No.
119, Great Porter Square. The inquest was
held this morning, and a verdict of accidental
death by burning was returned. As a rule
such inquests are dull, miserable affairs, and
there is but little variety in the evidence presented
to the coroner and his panel, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
this special case were elements of unexpected
romance which raised it far above the ordinary
level of a simple death by misadventure.</p>

<p>Last evening a private note was sent to our
office, signed by Frederick Holdfast, requesting
as an act of justice, that the Special Reporter
who wrote &ldquo;The Romance of Real Life&rdquo; from
Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s account of her career and
misfortunes, should attend and take whatever
notice of the proceedings he might deem fit
and proper. In accordance with the request
our Special Reporter attended, and the present
report is written by him for our paper. The
disclosures which were made at the inquest
were as interesting as they were surprising,
and our Reporter thanks Mr. Frederick
Holdfast for the opportunity afforded him of
being present.</p>

<p>At the inquest our Reporter renewed his
acquaintance with Mr. Goldberry, solicitor, a
gentleman whose name will be remembered
as having voluntarily come forward to defend
Antony Cowlrick at the Martin Street Police
Court, when, upon the barest suspicion, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a tittle of direct evidence, that person
was accused by the police of the murder of a
man unknown in No.&nbsp;119, Great Porter
Square. Our readers will remember how
stoutly, and under what disadvantages, Mr.
Goldberry defended the man wrongfully
accused of the crime; how he protested
against the numerous remands, and lifted up
his voice in the cause of justice against
Scotland Yard officialism; and how at length,
to the manifest chagrin of the police, Antony
Cowlrick was discharged from custody. The
particulars of the interview which took place
in Leicester Square, a few minutes after
Antony Cowlrick&rsquo;s departure from the Police
Court, between our Reporter, Mr. Goldberry,
and the accused man, was fully reported in
our columns. In that interview our Reporter
lent Antony Cowlrick a sovereign, which was
faithfully repaid. We purpose reprinting in
a pamphlet that report and the &ldquo;Romance
in Real Life,&rdquo; in addition to what appears in
our present issue relating to the case.
They are worthy of a record in a more permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
form than the columns of a newspaper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Goldberry to
our Reporter, referring to that interview,
&ldquo;that Antony Cowlrick said to me that if at
any time he should need my services, he
would call upon or send for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied our Reporter, &ldquo;and I
remember, also, that Antony Cowlrick asked
you if you thought God would allow the guilty
to escape, or that He needed the assistance of
a lawyer to punish the man who shed another&rsquo;s
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Goldberry, gravely, &ldquo;he
used those words, and in this case they are
justified by events. God has punished the
murderers without the assistance of a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you recall the name of Antony
Cowlrick?&rdquo; inquired our Reporter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am here to represent him. He
has not only paid me for my past services&mdash;forcing
the money upon me&mdash;but he has
thanked me for them, which, in the bitterness
of his heart, he declined to do, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
he was not asked, when he was finally discharged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a suspicion,&rdquo; remarked our Reporter,
&ldquo;at that time that he was a gentleman;
he spoke like one, and had the manner
of one. It was chiefly for that reason I took
an interest in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Goldberry, jocosely;
&ldquo;you wanted copy. Every man to his trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could retort with good effect,&rdquo; said our
Reporter, good-humouredly, &ldquo;but I spare
you. Will Antony Cowlrick be here this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and others whom you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a lady and a gentleman
entered the room in which the inquest was
held, and advancing to Mr. Goldberry shook
hands with him. The gentleman was Antony
Cowlrick, who, after a few words with his
lawyer, turned, and offered his hand to our
Reporter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must apologise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for not
having kept the half-appointment I made
with you on the day you so generously lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
me the sovereign in Leicester Square, but I
had my reasons, which you will understand
when I tell you as much of my story as I
think it proper for you to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I attend here,&rdquo; said our Reporter, &ldquo;on
behalf of my paper, in response to a letter
sent to our editor by Mr. Frederick Holdfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Frederick Holdfast,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
&ldquo;Antony Cowlrick was an assumed
name; I could not use my own when I was
falsely accused of the murder of my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned aside with quivering lips, and
our Reporter, holding his grief in respect, did
not intrude upon it. The face of the lady
who accompanied Frederick Holdfast appeared
singularly familiar to our Reporter,
and his curiosity was presently appeased by
Mr. Goldberry, who informed him that she
was the lady who, by the happiest of chances,
met Mr. Frederick Holdfast in Leicester Square
after his discharge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were she willing to allow herself to be
used in such a way,&rdquo; observed the lawyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;her photograph to-morrow could be sold in
thousands all over England. But she does
not belong to that class of woman. She is a
heroine, in the truest sense of the word. Mrs.
Holdfast, who supplied you with a Romance
in Real Life fit for a novel instead of the
columns of a newspaper, would not, in such
circumstances as these, have withstood the
temptation. But there are women and
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant you,&rdquo; said our Reporter, &ldquo;that I
was deceived in the character of Mrs. Holdfast.
Am I the first who has been beguiled
by the soft speeches of a fair woman? And,
my dear sir, if you want novels and romances,
take my word for it, you cannot do better
than go to the columns of a newspaper for
them. What has become of Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s
baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child will be cared for,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Goldberry, &ldquo;by Frederick Holdfast, and will
be brought up in ignorance of her mother&rsquo;s
crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proceedings at the inquest commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
languidly, but were soon brightened by the extraordinary
revelations made by the witnesses.
The bodies of the two persons burnt to death
were identified, and then evidence was given,
in dramatic sequence, in proof that, at the
time of their death, the deceased were engaged
in unlawful proceedings, and that the
male deceased had formed a deliberate plan
for setting fire to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Preedy, lodging-house keeper, deposed
to the letting of a furnished attic to a man
who gave the name of Richard Manx, and
who spoke like a foreigner. The rent of this
attic was three shillings a week, but she had
never seen the colour of Richard Manx&rsquo;s
money; he &ldquo;gave out&rdquo; to her that he was
very poor; she had no doubt he was the man
who was found dead in the next house;
neither had she any doubt that it was he who
had spread the report that her house was
haunted, and that he did it to ruin her. This
witness rambled in her evidence, and caused
great laughter by her irrelevant replies to
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Whittaker, lodging-house keeper in
Buckingham Palace Road, deposed to the
letting of her first-floor to Mr. Pelham at a
rental of three guineas per week. He paid
his rent regularly, and she believed him to be
a gentleman of considerable means. She
recognised the body of the male deceased as
Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>The principal detective employed by Mr.
Frederick Holdfast testified that the male
body was that of Richard Manx, otherwise
Pelham, a notorious blackleg; that he had
lodged at No.&nbsp;118, Great Porter Square as
Richard Manx, and in Buckingham Palace
Road as Mr. Pelham; that he (the detective)
was employed to watch the deceased on
suspicion that he was implicated in the
murder of Mr. Holdfast, senior; that on the
night of the fire he saw a female enter 118,
Great Porter Square, in the company of the
deceased; and that this female was Mrs.
Holdfast, widow of the gentleman who had
been murdered some months ago.</p>

<p>A sensation was then caused by the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of Mr. Frederick Holdfast as a
witness. He recognised the bodies as those
of Mr. Pelham and Mrs. Holdfast, his father&rsquo;s
second wife. Before his father contracted
a second marriage he had an acquaintance
with the deceased persons in Oxford.
Mr. Pelham was a blackleg, and had been
expelled from the company of gentlemen for
cheating with dice; and Mrs. Holdfast was
a woman not entitled to respect. The witness,
in reply to questions put by his lawyer,
Mr. Goldberry, said he was the man who,
under the name of Antony Cowlrick, had
been wrongfully charged at the Martin Street
Police-court with the murder of a gentleman,
who, it was now known, was his
father; and that he had in his possession
evidence in his father&rsquo;s handwriting which
proved, beyond the possibility of doubt, that
his father had been murdered by one or
both of the deceased. The other portions of
this witness&rsquo;s evidence, relating to his taking
possession of the house No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter
Square, and to the watch he set upon Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Pelham&rsquo;s movements, are fully detailed in
our verbatim report of the inquest, and will
be found most startling and dramatic.</p>

<p>Even more dramatic was the evidence of the
next witness, Blanche Daffarn, Mr. Frederick
Holdfast&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>, a young lady of great personal
attractions. For the purpose of clearing
her lover from the dreadful accusation
brought against him, she had disguised herself
as a servant, and had taken service as
a maid-of-all-work with Mrs. Preedy. It was
through her instrumentality that Pelham and
Richard Manx were discovered to be one and
the same person, and had it not been for her
courage and devotion there is but little doubt
that the guilty ones would have escaped.
She gave her evidence with clearness and
modesty, and she was frequently interrupted
by murmurs of applause, which the Coroner
did not attempt to suppress.</p>

<p>It might have been supposed that the
climax of interest was reached when the fair
witness, towards whom every face in the
room was turned in admiration, took her seat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
but it was not; a higher point was attained
upon the appearance of a little girl, a mere
child, whom our Reporter at once recognised
as Fanny, a match girl, with whom our
readers have already made acquaintance.
The brightness, the vivacity, and the adventures
of this little waif in connection with
the case, no less than her sensibility and
gratitude towards her guardian angel, Miss
Blanche Daffarn, produced a profound impression.
It would be hard to say whether tears
or smiles predominated while this intelligent
and grateful child stood before the Coroner;
both were freely produced by the wonderful
touches of nature which gleamed through
little Fanny&rsquo;s narrative, which she was allowed
to relate almost without interruption from
Coroner and jury. It is pleasant to be able
to state that Fanny&rsquo;s future is made safe;
Mr. Frederick Holdfast and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i> are
her protectors. The child is rescued from
the gin shop and the gutter.</p>

<p>The inquest was over, and still the persons
in the crowded room lingered for a parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
glance at those who had played their parts in
the strange and varied drama. The interest
in the proceedings had extended beyond the
Court, and a large concourse of persons had
gathered outside, eager to see the brave young
lady and the child, whose names will be mentioned
in terms of admiration in every home
in the kingdom. Such is the power of the
newspaper. To convey to remote distances,
into village and city, to the firesides of the
poor and the rich, the records of ennobling
deeds, and to cause &ldquo;God bless you little
Fanny!&rdquo; &ldquo;May you live happy lives,
Frederick and Blanche!&rdquo; to be breathed by
the millions whose hearts shall be stirred by
this story of love and crime, of cunning
which over-reached itself and suffering which
blossomed into sweetness, the last scenes of
which were enacted in a common lodging-house
in Great Porter Square.</p>
